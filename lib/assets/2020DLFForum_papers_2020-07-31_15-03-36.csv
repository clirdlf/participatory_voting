This information is critical to our upcoming platform migration.

When a digital collection used to be created, it was enough that the collection itself was available. Over the past 3 years, we have captured the who, what, when, where, and how relating to each and every digital collection. In many cases for the older digital collections, we had misplaced or never had a lot of needed information. I’ll share how we dealt with this issue and how we changed our workflow for creating new digital collections to prevent this issue in the future.

We made decisions about the digital environment and its structure based on who, internal and external, needed to access the documentation and when during the digital collection lifecycle. I’ll share how we considered user access and controls during implementation.

This documentation work is part of the assessment of digital collections on which we presented two years ago to the DLF community. We hope to share our workflow and approach in hopes that we can collaborate with others as they consider their long-term organizational needs around documentation for any digital project.","Institutional knowledge needs to be documented in a shared space, not kept in an individual’s head or location only accessible to a single person.

With Miriam Posner’s call to “come up with better ways of investing in people’s long-term potential as scholars” in mind, Leigh Bonds developed a professional development program to provide disciplinary librarians opportunities to attend immersive workshops in digital scholarship. Those participating in the program could choose from workshops that provide a general overview of the digital scholarship methods and tools; a subject-specific overview of methods and tools; or intensive training on a specific method, tool, or topic. The executive team approved a pilot program (2019-20) to focus on digital humanities, funding eight librarians in the arts and humanities liaison cohorts, special collections, and area studies. During the pilot year, the minimum requirements for participants included developing at least one annual goal related to digital scholarship, joining the campus DH Slack channel, and participating in the fall University Libraries’ Digital Scholarship Forum.

Minimally, Bonds anticipated these workshops would enable librarians to identify either research projects or course assignments that could be enhanced by using a digital method/tool. At most, she thought they would prepare her colleagues to collaborate with researchers on projects, collaborate with faculty and graduate students to integrate digital scholarship instruction and projects into courses, and/or develop their own digital projects. With six participating in the pilot, the program proved transformational: each participant benefitted from having intensive workshop experiences to not only delve deeply into the method(s)/tool(s), but also develop close connections to broader networks of colleagues and practitioners. Participants attended DHSI, UPenn's DREAMLab, HILT, Princeton’s Slavic DH Summer Workshop, ARL's Digital Scholarship Institute, and the DLF Forum’s pre-conference workshops. Each successfully integrated their learning into their librarianship, and began generating new ideas around collections and discussing those ideas across the organization. On their own initiative, the first cohort formed a bi-weekly working group to support one another as they integrated DH methods into their librarianship and scholarship. Based on these successful outcomes, the Libraries’ management committee approved a two-year extension of the program, expanding it to ten participants that include librarians from the social sciences and sciences.

This panel will provide an overview of the program and its outcomes, providing conference attendees with a potential model for building capacity for DS support at their own institutions. Bonds will outline details about the program—including participant requirements and costs—and discuss the ripple effect the program has had across the organization. Three participants will then share the experiences of those from their respective areas and discuss the program’s impact on their librarianship and scholarship: Courtney Hunt will represent participants from the arts and humanities liaison cohort; Jen Schnabel, special collections; and Ann Marie Davis, area studies.

Taking a cue from “What is a computational essay?”, Stephen Wolfram’s 2017 blog post, we generated our own Computational Essays, interrogating and defining just what that might mean along the way.

The resulting projects make use of Observable, a new JavaScript notebook platform, and are inspired as much by code studies as by the code notebooks prevalent in science pedagogy, not to mention Miriam Posner’s often-cited digital humanities capstone assignment. The Computational Essay here serves as a central, flexible tool imbricating code and prose, a single artifact in which HTML text, executable scripts, and their outputs appear without apparent hierarchy privileging one over the other.

Students had the semester to consider a topic of interest and find a corresponding dataset, and through trial and error, engage both visual and discursive narratives “in” the data as well as observations “about” the data. Shuttling between issues of representation, standards, infrastructure, code, and rhetoric, students had the opportunity to wrestle with major themes of the fellowship. Our presentation will outline our approach and explore the ways the Computational Essay might be used as a critical, playful mode of encountering code.

Projects begin with some form of data (text, images, csv files), that evolves into planning documentation (grant proposals, wireframes, productions plans), which leads to the project site (HTML/CSS). It can be overwhelming planning to preserve an entire interactive website as one entity. This presentation outlines our approach to breaking down a DH project into individual components, applying a preservation method appropriate to its content type, and then packaging each component together for long-term storage.

This approach relies on emulation over migration to address format obsolescence. Since each component is a unique format, and all of the components are packaged together, file format migration would be performed manually. This is not a scalable method. By planning for emulation and reconstruction of a website, we can develop a streamlined workflow for appraising, packaging, and preserving content. For this approach to be effective, documentation for each component is critical. Documentation is a driving force behind successful emulation to capture not only the technical components and decisions, but to establish a clear understanding of the goal and purpose of the project.

This presentation is the result of a test case performed on a current DH project to export and appraise the content and supporting infrastructure, apply individual preservation methods, and reconstruct the project from those components. This aligns with the conference topic Project management as we are providing a potential workflow for producing preservation-friendly DH projects.

Every migration of digital collections presents its own set of challenges unique to the institution and the platforms involved. Digital practitioners must think creatively and develop innovative solutions to overcome these challenges. This panel goes beyond offering migration strategies and encourages digital practitioners to undertake large-scale work on digital collections by re-framing migration as an opportunity for transformation rather than an obstacle to overcome. Panelists will share experiences with migration involving Islandora, CONTENTdm, ArchivesSpace, Knowvation, and in-house built digital content management systems. They will specifically speak to how they have taken advantage of migrations to advocate for additional resources, collaborate within and across institutions, evaluate usability, overhaul metadata, and otherwise optimize their digital collections.

Each presenter will begin with “two truths and a lie” about their migration story and poll the audience. This will create a space for both presenters and audience members to discuss missteps, failures, and sacrifices inherent to the migration process. Presenters will showcase how these lapses shouldn’t be covered up, but instead utilized for the enhancement of the repository.

These presentations will provide the basis for a discussion with the audience on concrete strategies for advocacy, effective collaboration, user research, and stakeholder management, in addition to broader inspiration to tackle transformative change.

Qualitative data have been shared, archived, and reused for decades in an effort to advance scientific discoveries about human behavior, reduce burden on research subjects, and support larger-scale, longitudinal research. Librarians and data curators have developed a suite of data stewardship strategies that support responsible reuse of qualitative data—for example, data management planning, metadata schemes, and restricted access.

Arguing that both the matrix and the ethical guidelines are needed to effectively and equitably assess use and reuse, the presenters will conclude the talk by articulating how the the two resources begin to address the lack of standards and common practices as well as by situating these outputs in the larger work of their IMLS-funded project “Digital Content Reuse Assessment Framework Toolkit.”",,,"Thompson, Santi",University of Houston,United States of America,North_America, ,sathompson3@uh.edu,,"astein@illinois.edu, sathompson3@uh.edu, ejkelly@loyno.edu, kinza.masood@mwdl.org, muglia@usc.edu, ashiri@ualberta.ca, liz.woolcott@usu.edu, joyce.chapman@gmail.com, derrickj@american.edu, myrna.e.morales@gmail.com","Stein Kenfield, Ayla;

Alternative or mitigative models to this colonization have emerged in response: decolonizing, postcolonial, postcustodial, and slow archives. This presentation discusses an alternative model based on the Digital Library of the Caribbean (dLOC), which incorporates tenants of shared governance, mutual aid, generous thinking, community building, polycentrism, collaborative pluralism, and mutual dependency. Importantly, we discuss dLOC’s ways of working: utilizing concepts and methods from agile/scrum technical development and managerial theories based on fairness, fostering self-determination and supporting our communities.

dLOC’s alternative model is baked-in and extends through all aspects, including organizational design and technical development. For example, dLOC’s technical team follows agile and scrum for equitably engaging stakeholders to support each according to their needs. While agile and scrum are often utilized for deeply capitalistic ends, these are also methods that avoid top-down controls and instead enable voice of those most in need and most impacted by digital library technologies. These range from developers to stakeholders at partner institutions. Additionally, dLOC’s alternative model reflects concepts from progressive management theory that have developed over time in the literature but are not commonly applied to scholarship on digital libraries. These broad concepts include agency, procedural justice, and organizational support, and translate to meaningful work and community supports for other stakeholders and institutions.","Power inequities mean even well-intended libraries routinely disrupt people’s knowledge of and access to their cultural heritage.

Hashicorp's Vault platform has made it possible for us to implement a lightweight solution for secure, zero-knowledge encryption of deposited datasets, while still facilitating access requests.","Digital repositories have historically avoided accepting deposit of sensitive data, including all human subjects data which has not been adequately de-identified, on the basis that they cannot provide adequate encryption and access controls to avoid a breach in cases where disclosure risk may be very high. This leads to researchers being underserved by our existing platforms, especially in the social sciences, where there may not be adequate funding to support bespoke platforms for sensitive data retention, and it limits the guidance that we or our ethics boards can offer them. We have developed a solution using Hashicorp's Vault platform that enables zero-knowledge (i.e., inaccessible to the repository managers) deposit of sensitive data to Canada's Federated Research Data Repository, while still facilitating discovery and managed access to these data sets. Our implementation does not require depositors or other users to have any special knowledge of encryption tools, and does not require researchers to retain their own encryption keys, increasing accessibility and minimizing the risk of data loss. We have also begun to adapt our curation guidelines to ensure that encrypted data remains discoverable from its metadata, while ensuring that our users understand the different considerations in working with encrypted packages.

These openly-licensed workflows and a corresponding community engagement policy (https://digital.lib.berkeley.edu/about) reduce institutions’ burden of developing expertise in complex areas of law and policy, and address opportunities to make localized determinations when uncertainty arises—such as when metadata or rights information is lacking.

The workflows will help libraries, archives, and museums navigate the following essential digitization issues:
- Ethics: Are there social or religious customs, or other circumstances—such as threats of personal or legal harm, or risks of exploitation of people, natural or cultural resources, or indigenous knowledge—that may or should impact digitization of the collections materials?
- Copyright: Are the collections materials protected by copyright and, if so, is the institution the copyright holder? If not, does a relevant copyright exception apply that permits creation and distribution of digital copies anyway?
- Contracts: Do provisions in gift or donor agreements limit the conditions under which digitization services or access can be provided?
- Privacy: Do the collections reveal information that could impinge upon the privacy rights of the subjects under federal and state laws?

Particular attention will be given to the ethics workflow’s localized practices (http://ucblib.link/34D) which promote social justice by adopting an ethics of care approach that balances whether the value to cultural communities, researchers, or the public outweighs the potential for harm or exploitation of people, resources, or knowledge.
