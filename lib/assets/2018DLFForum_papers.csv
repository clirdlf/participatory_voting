The archaeologists and the USF libraries collaborated to create access to these rich findings and provide unique discovery experiences for users to understand both ancient and recent human history and culture. 
This poster discusses the file transfer & processing, metadata creation, data crosswalk, final collection creation/presentation, and data preservation. For archaeological data projects, the files include text, images and digital 3D models. File preparations include normalizing filenames while preserving the original names, adding local digital object identifiers, and generating presentation versions. Submission packages for bulk deposit into the repository are programmatically generated which also applies constant metadata using a template for the project. This includes descriptive metadata collected from researchers, mapped to Dublin Core/MODS and VRA Core. Individual projects are cross-aggregated under a parent collection for browsing and searching. Finally, in addition to hosting the metadata and digital surrogates in the repository, we digitally preserve all of the master archival files for long-term preservation in an OASIS/PREMIS compliant digital archive.",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2018--0700:00,,0

In online environments, the possibility of tracking by 3rd parties, usage of HTTPS/TLS to provide secure connections, and easy disclosure of a site’s privacy policies all have implications for user privacy. This talk presents new empirical evidence about these issues and discusses their ethical implications. Data about the incidence of 3rd-party tracking, usage of HTTPS by default, and easy discoverability of a privacy policy or terms of service (TOS) were collected for public libraries across Canada and the United States. The sample consisted of 178 public libraries; members of the Canadian Urban Libraries Council and Urban Libraries Council. Several common commercial databases (e.g. OverDrive) were also examined using the same criteria. Results show that only 12% of libraries were devoid of 3rd-party tracking, with Google Analytics being the most common 3rd-party tracker. While libraries may support HTTPS under certain circumstances, it was found that a majority of libraries serve neither their websites nor their online catalogs (OPACs) HTTPS by default. Regarding disclosure of possible tracking, it was found that 58% of libraries did not link to a TOS or privacy policy from their homepage. Together with previous research on the usage of privacy-enhancing tools in public libraries, these results suggest that public libraries are accessories to 3rd party tracking on a large scale.

Ahead of the migration, we need to know whether any given collection can be migrated in its current state, identify issues that could cause problems during a migration, and prioritize what needs to be addressed before the migration. We also recognize that not all collections may be able to migrate quickly, so we need to assess how to handle those.

Using a pilot group of collections to start the assessment, we identified aspects of the assessment that we needed to change, including the specific information to be gathered, the terminology and definitions of terms we were using in the assessment, and changes in our workflow. The assessment also grew in scope as we began to work with the Library Copyright Office. Legal considerations, including the creation of robust rights memos for each digital collection, became a part of the assessment, preparing the foundation for collections to be migrated.

Well-funded institutions often have the ability to develop tailor-made specifications for the digitization of their analog video objects. Standards of this kind are often derived from the needs of for-profit industries and may be unsuitable for smaller memory institutions. While the open-source community has been developing tools, encodings and formats for the cultural heritage community at a healthy rate in recent years, many of the institutions that would best benefit from these tools may be unaware of them. 

My research seeks to provide insight into how moving image preservation professionals work with - and sometimes against - for-profit broadcast and film production paradigms in order to produce standards governing video digitization in the memory realm.

For those secondary and post-secondary instructors seeking to integrate primary source materials into their courses, there have emerged several online portals and interfaces which allow users to shape and curate learning experiences suited to their students’ abilities. 

In 2017, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum launched its own digital primary source tool; ""Experiencing History: Holocaust Sources in Context"" was designed specifically to introduce primary sources on the Holocaust to a variety of student audiences in courses dealing with the Holocaust both directly and tangentially. Focusing on emerging adults aged 17 to 30, the sources featured in the thematic section Jewish Perspectives on the Holocaust--including letters, diaries, testimonies, photographs, video footage, and audio--sought to correct the overrepresentation of perpetrator-produced sources in the digital realm. In the eight months since Experiencing History’s public launch, 293 courses in 28 disciplines at 242 institutions have adopted the tool, reaching students in 34 states, as well as 14 countries around the globe. 

From the genesis of the project, Experiencing History’s development team has worked to ensure the accessibility and applicability of primary source documents on the Holocaust in a wide variety of disciplinary contexts. While existing resources include online source repositories, structured primary-source lesson plans, and digital exhibitions, a more expansive range of disciplines--including law, sociology, political science, geography, and others--can benefit from Experiencing History’s curated and contextualized source collections. How do teachers and learners in these disciplinary areas approach teaching with primary source documents? What unique applications do digital primary sources on the Holocaust offer for a diverse set of users? What obstacles do these materials, in this format, present for those working in interdisciplinary settings or with students from divergent backgrounds?

The proposed workshop brings together college educators from a variety of backgrounds--German Studies, Religious Studies, and History in a study-abroad setting--to consider these questions. In a short series of presentations, instructors will reflect on their experiences with using primary sources on the Holocaust in their courses, and offer insights on digital learning tools more generally. The focus of the ensuing discussion will form around the unique contributions of digital primary source learning, with the aim of better understanding its implementation in interdisciplinary contexts and efficacy for different pedagogical applications.",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,This panel is intended as a facilitated conversation that will aim to draw in those attending to create an interactive experience.

In March of 2018, a local television reporter contacted the University of Louisville Archives and Special Collections referring to historic images inside the lobby of a newly constructed Omni Hotel in downtown Louisville – images that the hotel found on the Archives’ Digital Collections website and obtained as prints through a reproduction request. For several days Archives staff assisted the reporter by providing him with additional information about the photographs: possible identification of subjects, historical background, and the name of a local historian who could be on camera and provide historical context. Yet when the story aired a few days later, archives staff were dismayed and frustrated to see that the reporter used tropes in describing the images as “lost to time and the archive” until they were “discovered” by the Omni Hotel. This presentation will describe the viral twitter thread that criticized the news story, the collective response to the reporter from the Archives staff, and how a relationship was fostered with the reporter to create more news stories which highlight the labor of archivists that make these “discoveries” possible.",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,"Additional links to the news story and the viral tweet:

The workshop takes as its foundation an analysis of power drawn from the labor movement, where majorities are built person by person and conversation by conversation and then mobilized to action in response to particular demands. Digital workers are not all protected by unions, and the contingent, sporadic, and grant-funded nature of much of the work can mean that the structure of a union is not available and difficult to build. But the principles remain the same: change requires a concrete demand, a group of people committed to making it happen, and a plan to make things move.

The project is based on the Three-Legged-Stool Model developed for the Digital Preservation Management Workshop.

By creating three Fellowship roles which reflect each leg of the stool (organizational frameworks, digital technologies, and ongoing resourcing) the project has attempted to establish sustainable digital preservation programs at each institution. Each role has been mirrored across the two institutions to ensure that the Fellows have ongoing peer support and the opportunity to develop joint resources.   

This talk presents the deliverables from the first two years of the DPOC project. During 2016-2018 the DPOC project has developed policies, strategies, completed technical audits of collection content, and piloted an all staff training program. The work undertaken by the Fellows has resulted in a number of business cases, looking to address digital preservation in a holistic fashion in their local organisations. The training program has also opened a number of opportunities to collaborate with associated college libraries and archives.  

The talk evaluates both the success of the Fellowship model itself, and examines to what extent the project has succeeded in its goal of embedding sustainability as a principle for future digital preservation activities. As the project draws to a close at the end of 2018 - this talk will outline the challenges and strategies which it has used to enable ongoing support for the groundwork laid by the Fellows over the past two years.

Over the course of four years, one and half million pages from their collections were digitized. This was all made possible by funding from the Polonsky Foundation.

At the end of 2017, the digitization work had all been completed, with all the master images having been saved to offline tape storage. As a conclusion to this project, it was decided that an audit of the output from the digitization work would be required. 

Our poster discusses the stages that were involved to audit and validate these images, the challenges faced, and how they were overcome. We hope to raise awareness of the issues of dealing with large volumes of data at various stages of the audit and validation process, for example the struggles that were faced when attempting to bulk restore Oxford’s part of the digitization project from offline tape storage.

One of the key pieces of software used in the audit was JHOVE2, we highlight some of the current issues with this tool, such as the XML outputs, the need to transcribe these outputs with XSLT to provide a simple CSV output, and efforts which the auditors made in order to run JHOVE at scale (due to inefficiency caused by JHOVE’s current design).",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2018--2600:00,,0

PA Digital’s aim is to expose the digital collections of Pennsylvania’s cultural heritage institutions for wide discoverability and use. In 2018, PA Digital began a pilot project to curate primary source sets from the hub’s digital collections for use in K-12 classrooms. The project goals are to engage users by curating themed sets around Pennsylvania history, provide a new entry point for users into PA Digital, and connect educators with primary source materials.

This pilot project surfaced several questions for us to work through related to the identification of themes and project sustainability. Our collection contains over 280,000 items from cultural heritage institutions across a wide and diverse state. Pennsylvania has a history of varied economic interests, political leanings, and urban and rural division. Creating primary source sets covering this history, pulled from the existing resources in PA Digital, while reaching audiences across a large state is an ongoing challenge.

Considering the obstacles laid out, we are also asking questions around how to sustain this initiative. This project will fall under the auspices of a newly formed team focused on curation of PA Digital collections. We are eager to hear from the community about success and challenges with other curatorial projects such as this.

The presentation will introduce the primary source set project, dig into the challenges, and solicit community feedback. Disclaimer: this presentation will not involve actual sorcery, just a bit of magical thinking.",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2018--2600:00,,0

With that thought and the #collectionsasdata discourse prominent in his mind, Becker worked with two graduate students during summer 2017 to openly publish all of the project data. To accomplish this, Becker and his collaborators utilized a Jekyll-based, static website generator and a variety of data-driven tools to create https://ctrl-shift.org, a platform that includes the audio, video, photography, and transcripts he collected as well as his resulting analyses.

Whether physical or digital, museum records form an essential narrative of an object’s movement through time and space as told by various records, such as deeds of gift, correspondence, dealer catalogs, and other documentary forms; without these records an artwork’s history disappears. In American art museums, much of what comprises an art object’s provenance is never sent to the archives for long-term care; it is stewarded by curators, conservators, and registrars. Traditionally kept in filing cabinets for easy access, these records are increasingly created digitally and stored in databases and servers where they are much more vulnerable than their analog counterparts.

Building on recent work in archival studies that has begun to investigate the impact of community archives on identity and representation, this panel addresses the ways in which community archives challenge dominant strands of archival theory and practice, specifically dominant conceptions of time, access, community, and agency. Based on focus groups with 54 community members at five different community archives sites in Southern California (Lambda Archives; Southeast Asian Archive at University of California, Irvine; Little Tokyo Historical Society; La Historia Society of El Monte; and the Studio Southern California History), each paper in this panel uses empirical data to develop new theories and explore new forms of practice. First, Michelle Caswell will address the ways in which the users of community archives called into question linear notions of time and dominant progress narratives, instead positing community-based memory practice as an interruption into cycles of oppression. Next, Joyce Gabiola will examine how communities impacted by white supremacy and hetero-patriarchy have internalized their own symbolic annihilation, opening up space for the right not to be documented and pushing back on dominant ideas of the importance of representation. Thirdly, Jessica Tai will explore how members of the communities served and represented by community archives conceived of archival records as agents, possessed or empowered with their own sense of purpose, will, and movement. And finally, Gracen Brilmyer will interrogate the “community” in community archives, reporting on how users of community archives imagine themselves to be part of a larger trajectory of archival users across space and time. Taken as a whole, these papers reveal how dominant archival concepts and practices fall short once we begin to center the ideas and actions of those most marginalized.

Considering the history of theft, misappropriation, and cultural imperialism perpetrated by cultural heritage institutions on Indigenous communities, the problems and possibilities associated with description of Indigenous visual culture provide a perspective on digital collections ethics, critical information studies, and the development of redemptive technologies to support marginalized communities.
The study examined the issues associated with bridging the semantic gap between image and text and the challenges that practitioners face when ascribing subject terms to images, while assessing whether existing tools, controlled vocabularies, and institutional cultures promote culturally sensitive and epistemologically relevant metadata. Findings reflect the neutrality, appropriateness, and/or inappropriateness of subject terms used by museum and library professionals. The study found that differences in professional practice between libraries and museums were most pronounced when considering the notion of image subject access, controlled vocabulary usage, and appropriateness of subject terms. Specifically, overreliance of libraries on LCSH produced subject metadata that was more frequently inappropriate than museum metadata using other vocabularies.

High fidelity capture means that from a user's perspective there is a complete or high level of similarity between the original web pages and the archived copies, including the retention of important characteristics and functionality such as: Flash-based components, video or audio that requires a user to press ‘play’, or resources that require entry of login credentials for access (e.g. social media accounts). Webrecorder can capture most types of media files, JavaScript and user triggered actions, which are things that most crawlers struggle with or are unable to obtain.

How to manage the collected materials, download them (as a WARC file) and open a local copy offline using Webrecorder Player will also be covered in this workshop. With a model of human scale collecting (one page at a time) Webrecorder makes it possible to acquire and save web content as you browse it on the live web. Web collecting has been a fairly exclusive practice since configuring and running web crawlers, such as Heiritrix, requires extensive expertise but Webrecorder makes it possible for anyone to collect web pages as they browse those pages. 

Webrecorder’s high fidelity capture has been developed to be precise enough to capture internet art and serve as a ‘museum quality’ tool for collecting, which benefits all users who wish to have a high level of similarity between the original and archived copy. Workshop attendees will be given an overview of Webrecorder’s features then engaged in hands-on activities and discussions. Further instruction will alternate with opportunities for participants to use the tools introduced and share their thoughts or questions.
 
Human scale web collecting with Webrecorder is not expected to meet all the requirements of a large web archiving program but can satisfy many needs of researchers, smaller web collecting initiatives and be used in personal digital archiving projects. Larger collecting programs, such as those at national libraries or major research universities, can benefit from using Webrecorder to capture dynamic content and user triggered behaviors on websites.

With a tool like Webrecorder anyone can get started with web archiving quickly, which is empowering both to web archivists/information professionals and their stakeholders such as researchers (especially if stakeholders are given information about using Webrecorder themselves).

Features for describing and managing one’s collections in Webrecorder, that are due for release in May, 2018, will be covered in addition to Webrecorder’s current core tool set.

Our Center for Digital Scholarship at the NYU Abu Dhabi Library in the UAE opened in 2014 and at the time had few models to look to regionally to help shape its identity. Since opening, what has proven most successful in defining our Center is building close relationships with faculty and trying to “just say yes.” Agility has proven key, allowing us to shift gears in response to our scholarly community’s requirements. This presentation will focus on the recent CDS/faculty research partnership in the interdisciplinary Music and Sound Cultures (MaSC) research group, a collaboration that helped define our unit’s mission.

As partners in the MaSC research group, we focus on the interdisciplinary study of musical rhythm through cultural heritage preservation and analysis of the rhythmic structures of non-Western music. Our two-pronged research project uses established library practices to preserve media and ephemera for the study of music from East Africa and the Arab Mashriq. Additionally, the CDS is building a digital compendium of music from the Library’s collection for computational analysis of rhythmic structures. This partnership has not only defined our unit as a research partner on campus, but helped shape our identity as a space for media reformatting and preservation, metadata description, research infrastructure, copyright consultant and project manager. This relationship developed at an opportune time, allowing the CDS to directly shape its presence on campus to faculty research needs, thus drawing additional research projects into the space. In this presentation I will discuss how this partnership helped shape an identity for a digital scholarship model at a new center on a global campus in the Middle East.",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2018--3000:00,,0

The full list of modules is:

• Enabling Programmatic Digital Preservation
• Selection
• Preparing for Submission
• Submission & Ingest
• Post-Submission
• Sustainability

The workshop aims at helping organizations develop and enact programmatic digital preservation, and the curriculum goes beyond the basics to help participants overcome obstacles to operationalizing digital preservation at their institutions. Based on analysis of existing trainings and interviews with diverse stakeholders, the curriculum focuses on organizational capacity development over individual professional development and is structured to include two representatives per institution (although this is not a requirement for this workshop instantiation). 

The workshop will be effective for organizations continuing in the critical work of preserving the scholarly, historical, and cultural record for this and future generations.

Beyond digitization, to facilitate discovery and research use, AV materials must also be described, however many items and collections lack sufficient metadata. In 2015, with the support of consulting firm AVP, the Indiana University Libraries conducted a planning project to research, analyze, and report on technologies, workflows, staffing, timeline and budgets to address the challenge of quickly and efficiently creating large quantities of metadata for mass-digitized AV collections. 

One of the outcomes of this planning project was identification of the need for a technology platform to support the incremental application of both automated and human-based processes to create and augment metadata. With support from a Mellon Foundation planning grant, Indiana University has partnered with experts from the University of Texas at Austin School of Information and AVP to explore the design of a software platform to support the incremental application of automated and human-based processes to create and augment metadata at large scales for AV collections. 

In this session, Juliet Hardesty (IU) and Amy Rudersdorf (AVP) will describe the proposed technical architecture for this system, dubbed the Audiovisual Metadata Platform (AMP), discuss the use cases and technical considerations that informed its design, and discuss next steps toward implementation and pilot testing.",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2018--0100:00,2018--0800:00,0

After a year of building and hosting Hyrax applications, from pre-release Hyrax 1 to the leading edge releases of Hyrax 2, we at Data Curation Experts have learned a few things. We’ve developed a playbook for getting Hyrax applications into production, which we publish on our website and refine over time. We’ve worked with institutions to manage their self-deposit workflows, and to adapt them to institutional requirements. We’ve integrated Hyrax with Shibboleth (and documented the process), and we’ve also integrated with Amazon’s email systems to send workflow email notifications (including a system to manage bounced messages). We are also building tools to allow Hyrax to scale -- including automated server provisioning, log aggregation, and performance monitoring. 

Most importantly, we are committing to long-term data stewardship. We are undertaking repository migration projects, and refining our process and toolset more with each migration effort. Within the Samvera community, we are planning and advocating for migration paths from previous Hydra / Samvera systems, as well as ensuring that future Hyrax development makes upgrades as easy as possible.

Design for Diversity is an IMLS-funded project focusing on the ways in which information systems embody and reinforce cultural norms, asking how we might design systems that account for diverse cultural materials and ways of knowing. By centering information systems, we focus on issues such as the harm caused by cataloging standards that classify living, breathing people as “illegal aliens”, or data models that enforce strict gender binaries such as “woman or man” when human experience is much broader. To empower cultural heritage practitioners in their advocacy around these issues, and also better educate the next generation of systems designers, we created a teaching and learning toolkit with case studies, readings, and other educational materials. 

This toolkit offers educators and learners a broad-based set of materials—including case studies, readings, assignment prompts, and annotated resources—that explore the challenges of building diversity and social justice into information systems at the deepest levels. The toolkit will help educate the next generation of systems creators and users through its use in both formal and informal educational environments. It also seeks to empower the current users of cultural heritage information systems—such as cataloging vocabularies, digital collections systems, data sharing standards, and online exhibit builders—to advocate for more inclusive practices in the design and use of those systems. 

In this workshop we will share and discuss the results of the project’s environmental scan, giving participants a thorough grounding in the ways issues of diversity and inclusion play out in cultural heritage information systems. We will then share and discuss the lessons we’ve learned so far about creating good community partnerships so that underrepresented groups become core partners in digital projects. We’ll lead participants through a process of brainstorming the systems and technical infrastructure in their own institution where they might want to evaluate inclusivity and make change. We’ll end with workshopping potential models for making organizational change and how the Toolkit might be used to create change.

Participants in this workshop will explore issues of diversity and inclusion in the technical systems we use every day, and also add their experiences to the toolkit through feedback and suggestions for new topics.

These institutions and the individuals who identify as library workers generally hold values and facilitate policies that support access to information as a resource, something of actual or potential use, rather than information as a commodity. However, market structures in contemporary society problematize access to information by attributing monetary value to such resources, and libraries and information workers are far from exempt from these tensions.

This presentation will examine the commodification of archival “information” through library-vendor contracts and licensing and the way in which this particular process of commodification leverages library labor to generate capital for private companies. Digitization and the creation of digital surrogates provide an ideal format for information to be commoditized by vendors (such as Adam Matthews, ProQuest, Gale): archival materials are often unrestricted by IP concerns, they are readily organized and described, fairly inexpensive to digitize, and are easily packaged (both intellectually and literally) for sale and distribution.

Through a discussion of information as a non-rival good (something consumed without preventing use by other potential users) and the barriers to this unlimited use (i.e. proprietary access points and IP laws), this presentation will address the way in which the commodification of archival information transforms the labor of library workers into what Marx defines as “productive labor” by converting archival materials into digital surrogates, negotiating for restricted delivery of the assets, and utilizing existing metadata to make this happen.",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2018--0200:00,,0

This panel will bring together project leaders on those grants: Community Standards for 3D Data Preservation (CS3DP), Building for Tomorrow, and Developing Library Strategy for 3D and Virtual Reality Collection Development and Reuse (LIB3DVR). Panelists will report on project outcomes and how these projects have been cross-collaborating in order to more effectively develop standards for creating, working with, and preserving 3D/VR cultural heritage collections. 

CS3DP is a collaboration between Washington University in St. Louis Libraries, University of Michigan Museum of Paleontology, and the University of Iowa Libraries. This project convenes leading experts and key stakeholders, including librarians, curators, faculty, professionals, and organizations from the U.S. and abroad to address issues of digital 3D data preservation. Forums included presentations, discussions, and collaborative work, with working groups convening between the forums. The national forums worked to lay the foundation for an organized community of practice to develop and move forward on shared standards for 3D data preservation.

In Building for Tomorrow, the Frances Loeb Library at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design convened two priority‐setting meetings of engaged stakeholders – architects, architectural historians, archivists, librarians, technologists, digital preservationists, and others to frame a national/international collaborative infrastructure to support long-term preservation of digital design data in the architecture and design fields. The first meeting in April 2018 produced a plan to focus on five key areas of work, and a steering committee met in May 2018 to develop an action agenda for implementing the plan over the next three to five years. 

LIB3DVR is a collaboration between Virginia Tech, Indiana University, and University of Oklahoma to convene a team of researchers, practitioners, and other leaders in imaging science and engineering, digital preservation, and digital libraries in a national forum to advance knowledge in archival and curation challenges in 3D/VR programs and collections. The project hosted three national forums on different aspects of 3D/VR. Core project staff with relevant experience attended each forum along with expert practitioners, educators, researchers, and industry representatives. Forum participants developed a roadmap and white paper for library adoption of 3D and VR services to support new ways of interacting with digital content for research and pedagogy. 

The panelists will discuss project findings as well as strategic benefits and logistical challenges in collaborating across sponsored project proposals in support of overlapping, complementary goals. The panelists will advocate for collaboration and knowledge sharing as a means of aligning distinct project activities with community-level goals.

These projects were made possible in part by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (LG-88-17-0171-17, LG-73-17-0141-17, LG-73-17-0004-17).

While libraries have built, enhanced, and expanded service offerings to support the management of research data, among other research lifecycle activities, these services tend to privilege quantitative approaches. Importantly, qualitative research can also be closely linked with social justice practices; qualitative methods can help tell stories that do not emerge from quantitative methods alone and libraries should have a stake in supporting this work.

Does emulation, or emulation-as-a-service, complicate the copyright story?
 
For many of the headaches collection managers face, the copyright doctrine of fair use provides a remedy. For some others, clarifications of this important limitation on the scope of copyright law can go a long way toward getting work done.  Although recent legal developments favor the work of memory institutions, archivists’ confidence in fair use has lagged behind.

Digital assets and unstructured metadata were stored on a dedicated server organized mainly by project; numerous assets were organized into a now-opaque folder structure that appears to have reflected different phases of processing the material. Many years and many terabytes later, the Library has begun embarking on a mission to more fully integrate a lifecycle approach to digital collection building, from preparation and liaison engagement through coordinating assets in delivery and preservation systems.

The first speaker (Helen Tibbo) on this panel will present the current iteration of the document and levels described in the document.  The Levels of Preservation document was created in 2013 by members of the NDSA community.  The original intent of the LoP was to create tiered set of recommendations for either preservation practitioners who were just starting out or for those looking to deepen their preservation strategy. Not meant as a comprehensive preservation strategy but rather a lightweight tool to encourage organizations to think through preservation issues.  The LoP are organized into five functional areas that are at the heart of digital preservation systems: storage and geographic location, file fixity and data integrity, information security, metadata, and file formats. By design, they do not cover policy or staffing considerations. They are considered to be a technical implementation of a variety of preservation decisions and are utilized by many organizations across the country and even internationally.

The second speaker (Karen Cariani) will give examples of how to use the tool and how it has been used by various organizations. Not meant to be definitive, but rather as a guide, organizations have utilized the levels in different ways.  For some, it is used as leverage to request resources to improve best practices within the organization.  For others it helped develop a roadmap and structure to improve preservation practices. 

The third speaker, Bradley Daigle, will discuss the NDSA LoP working group efforts to update the document.  With the current rapid changes in technology, a document that functions as the technical implementation of a preservation strategy, needs updating after 5 years.  In addition, after 5 years of active use, users have expressed the need to add features and considerations.  Expanding the scope of the levels is currently being discussed by the working group and the working group plans, ideas, and work to date to improve and update the document will be presented.

Information professionals recognize the need to preserve digital materials, but the decisions surrounding how to plan and implement a digital preservation program can be daunting, especially at smaller and under-represented institutions. In this session, instructors from the IMLS-funded Digital POWRR project and the NEH-funded Digital Assessment Training program discuss their experiences building an accessible curriculum while attendees from these programs share their experiences on how the trainings have impacted their work.

The Digital POWRR Project was launched in 2011 with the charge of evaluating and testing a number of digital preservation tools and services, with an eye on ease of implementation for institutions with restricted resources. The work undertaken on the first IMLS grant led to the creation of a one-day workshop, which helped the team disseminate research outputs in ways that benefited the wider community. Feedback from the workshops continued to indicate that the POWRR approach to digital preservation reverberated with a wide audience of professionals who were encountering roadblocks to implementing digital preservation at their institutions. Many such individuals come from or serve historically underrepresented people, collections, and communities with limited travel budgets, leaving many to feel isolated in performing digital preservation tasks.The POWRR Institute is attempting to try to fill this void; by providing accessible, grassroots instruction to a wide variety of workers who seek to augment or update their skillsets. The Institute allows attendees to work with instructors on the creation of a personalized “POWRR Plan” assessment document that will help guide their digital preservation efforts on the job. 

The Digital Assessment Training (DAT) program is a grant funded project from the NEH and led by the Northeast Document Conservation Center (NEDCC). DAT is a collaborative project that approaches digital preservation assessment and training through case-study assessments, shadowing opportunities, and workshops. Information on practical and sustainable stewardship of digital collections must be a critical central component of an institution’s strategic planning. Assessments, both physical and digital, provide a snapshot of current practices so that institutions can see where they are in the digital preservation planning process. The DAT program has worked to develop a framework for performing a digital preservation assessment and trains not only performs digital preservation assessments at institutions, but also trains individuals to perform these assessments with a focus on the needs of smaller and under-represented organizations.
 
This panel contains a mixture of POWRR and DAT instructors (Danielle Spalenka-DAT, Jaime Schumacher and Stacey Erdman-POWRR) and attendees (Stacey Erdman-DAT, Alexis Braun-Marks, Kristina Schulz, and Hannah Wang-POWRR, giving NDSA conference-goers the chance to get a sense of the full picture of the critical need for digital preservation training and assessments, while also seeing getting the perspective of attendees who have been through these training programs.

Shortly afterward, the Libraries established the “Maker Cart”: a mobile makerspace designed to facilitate outreach to the campus without being tied to a specific space. Over the past four years, makerspace outreach has grown to a regularly-occurring series, “Maker Mondays,” focused on DIY projects and innovative technologies that foster creativity and learning. Workshops have included an introduction to analog synthesis using littleBits kits, creating original animated short films by painting and etching the film itself, and animating GIFs using Photoshop.  This series has recently included workshops developed collaboratively with librarians who offer digital scholarship programming. 

Makerspace workshops using this model have numerous advantages, chiefly facilitating community building by interacting directly with interested attendees. Moreover, they are interdisciplinary, with interested attendees and instructors attending or offering these workshops out of curiosity and interest rather than a specific research need. Finally, they feature tangible learning outcomes to be constructed over the course of an hour such as an original film, musical composition, or screen-printed object. Based on the presenters’ experiences, these collaborative efforts have had a positive reciprocal impact on instructional design of digital scholarship and makerspace programming, and this presentation will discuss how these partnerships have advanced digital scholarship outreach at Indiana University.",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2018--0400:00,2018--0800:00,0

The provision of information literacy instruction, one-on-one research consultations, and access to resources are all paramount to ensuring students’ success in their academic endeavors. As undergraduate research programs have become more common, the possibilities for librarians to both lead and support such programs has expanded. Specialized research programs, such as those supporting digital scholarship and digital humanities work, offer more natural partnerships for librarians. This workshop will engage participants in discussion around models for developing and sustaining a digital scholarship fellowship program.

In 2017, librarians at Bucknell developed the Digital Scholarship Summer Research Fellows program, through which students learn about digital scholarship methods and tools, and apply those to their own independent research projects. During our initial program planning process, we connected with two peer institutions whose libraries host similar fellowship programs, to exchange ideas about how they developed and structured their programs. Through this process, we realized there are pockets of academic librarians developing digital scholarship research programs, but few external resources for those who want to start developing a program from the ground up. With two years of the fellowship program under our belts, we will draw on our own experiences, and collaborations with other institutions, to lead a workshop that focuses on the fundamentals of developing a librarian-led summer research program. We welcome participants who are already leading research programs at their own institutions to add to the conversation, share resources, and help develop a community of practice. 

At the conclusion of the workshop, participants will be able to do the following:

1) Identify partners on campus and at other institutions who could help support a digital scholarship student research fellowship / class / internship.
2) Develop strategies for supporting student research projects from beginning to end.
3) Consider strategies for ensuring the sustainability of a digital scholarship student research fellowship / class / internship.

This workshop will be led by members of the Digital Library Pedagogy working group (#DLFteach). It will also build on the ongoing, collaborative work of building an open resource for digital library pedagogy, described in the #DLFteach cookbook call for participation (bit.ly/cfp-dlfteach-cookbook).

The first hour will engage participants in an immersive introduction to digital library pedagogy as volunteers (identified prior to the workshop) lead “road tests” of lesson plans under development for the #DLFteach instructional cookbook project with participants in the role of learners. After participating in these road tests, attendees will have the opportunity to reflect on the instructional design principles incorporated into these lesson plans and provide feedback for improving them. 

The second hour will provide a deeper dive into two areas of instructional design that this working group has identified as being of interest to many digital library practitioners: developing learning outcomes and assessment techniques. The hour will begin with an introduction to these two phases of instructional design. We will then move to small group discussion and idea generation. Groups will work with examples of learning goals and comprehension checks developed by #DLFteach members prior to the workshop, then brainstorm additional examples of each.

This format is planned with two goals in mind: First, it is an experiment in flipping the model of instructional design workshops that this group has run at past Forums. Typically, our workshops have begun by presenting principles and led up to participants’ improvisational teaching demonstrations. This time, our goal is that, by leading off with teaching demonstrations, we will provide participants with a practical perspective on instructional design and an all-too-rare opportunity to observe others’ teaching in action. Second, we envision that the first hour of the event will be a focused, time-limited opportunity for those would like to contribute to the cookbook project as reviewers. Participants will be able to receive reviewer credit for feedback contributions during this session. For the second hour, rather than having participants design full lesson plans from start to finish as previous iterations of this workshop have done, we plan to focus on learning outcomes and assessment techniques as the “muddiest points” of instructional design. This will allow us to spend less time presenting theoretical background (valuable but sometimes difficult to apply) and more time exchanging ideas among practitioners with varying professional backgrounds and levels of experience.",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2018--0400:00,2018--0800:00,0

Bryn Mawr College, Grinnell College, and Wesleyan University all endeavour to contribute to the student-centered mission of their respective institutions by creating an infrastructure to provide its students with these opportunities both inside and out of the classroom. Through its Digital Scholarship Summer Fellows program at Bryn Mawr, a paid, full-time summer fellowship, students work on a public-facing digital scholarship project related to the history of women in science at Bryn Mawr. At Grinnell, students in Vivero Digital Scholarship Fellows program, commit to a two-year training and mentorship program that seeks to grow the diversity of the digital liberal arts community at Grinnell and beyond. Student opportunities to collaborate on digital scholarship projects at Wesleyan are more ad-hoc, but, like its peer institutions, Wesleyan is seeking to develop an undergraduate digital scholarship fellows program.

What all three institutions share in common through their student digital projects, is that they involve collaboration not just with faculty, but also with librarians, technologists, and other staff. This constellation of labor necessitates a reimagining of relationships, expectations, and project management that often is at odds with traditional hierarchies of power within a university. For example, how can meaningful and fairly compensated research experiences for students be created and sustained? How can the time and resources of the professional collaborators be accommodated within the demands of faculty expectations and timelines? What is the value of invisible and emotional labor, and how is it acknowledged and compensated? How and who is responsible for sustaining digital projects when not just students but also often faculty and professional staff are not permanent residents of a college?

For this discussion, we propose a two part session: 1) A roundtable “lightning round” in which panel participants introduce the opportunities and challenges faced at their institutions; 2) Moderated, open discussion around questions prepared in advance that address concerns of ethical labor relations that affect panel participants and audience members.

Digital Humanities A Framework for Institutional Planning, deem a mesh network model. In this model, the effort is a campus wide strategy that consists of various units, each with particular strengths. The idea of pooling resources across campus is a great idea and makes perfect sense on paper. However, in my experience, in actuality, this collaborative model is hard to execute, because working across departmental and unit divisions is a challenge. This presentation with cover the top 10 things I have learned about making this model work. The top ten list will cover topics such as ensuring that you’re not duplicating efforts, ways to find the right people to collaborate with in another unit, finding and gracefully inserting yourself into pre-existing interest groups, and much more. After three years of making the network model of Digital Scholarship work at two different institutions, I am eager to share what I have learned and talk to the audience about what has, and has not, worked for them. Theoretically, the network model makes a lot of sense for Digital Scholarship services and it seems to be growing in popularity, so I look forward to having a practical discussion about how we make it work on the ground.",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2018--0400:00,,0

The students are required to attend all the workshops and then each student will choose one of the methods and one of the tools we covered to complete their final project. But instead of offering the workshops during class time, as I have in the past, they will be held outside of class. And because the class has a small enrollment, we will be opening up the workshops to anyone in the University community.  We are hopeful that this arrangement will alleviate the teaching faculty member’s concerns about class time and that by opening up the workshops, the students in the course will be exposed to new ideas and approaches presented by people from outside their department. Additionally, by opening up the workshop students from programs that do not incorporate Digital Scholarship into their curriculum will still get a chance to learn about Digital Scholarship methods and tools if they are interested.

However, the utilization, scale, and impact of visualization environments and the scholarship created within them have not reached their fullest potential. A logical next step is to develop best practices and collaborative frameworks that can create economies of scale between installations.

NC State University Libraries has been awarded a three-year, $414,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to develop extensible models and programs for the creation and sharing of digital scholarship in such large-scale and immersive environments. Entitled “Visualizing Digital Scholarship in Libraries and Learning Spaces,” and nicknamed “Immersive Scholar”, the grant aims to 1) build a community of practice of scholars and librarians to help visually immersive, scholarly work enter the research lifecycle; and 2) overcome technical and resource barriers that limit the number of scholars and libraries who use visualization environments and the impact of generated knowledge. To achieve these goals, NCSU Libraries will collaborate with five teams at other institutions as well as creative residents at NC State to develop sharable, open-source technologies.

This talk will address the following topics:
-Current status of large-scale visualization environments in libraries.
-Rationale for the grant.
-Grant components.
-External partners and projects.
-Grant timeline.
-Expected outcomes.

Many of the items attached to the page fold out or can open to reveal more information. Ofen loose items are included between pages, and sometimes the deterioration of the scrapbook  has caused once attached items to detach from the page, making the original intent of the makers unknown and the scrapbook more challenging to handle. Unlike representing a standard book, where every page is visually consistent and the order of the images clearly represent the order of the pages in the physical book, scrapbooks are not so simple. In order to answer the question of how to best represent scrapbook materials in a digital environment, librarians at the University of North Texas conducted a usability study using paper prototyping to assess user preferences for scrapbook representation. During the study, participants were given sets of images of digitized pages and/or parts of pages of a scrapbook and asked which images they believed should be included and in what order.

These projects yield thousands of archival digital objects that require long-term preservation.

This taxonomic approach to describing digital research activities gives life to a shared vocabulary by which digital researchers in the humanities can more effectively classify their work. However, this taxonomy largely focuses on the activities of researchers in traditional humanities departments, grouping many of the activities of librarianship under the broad category of meta-activities (“community building,” “project management,” “teaching/learning”). In this panel session, we will build off of TaDiRaH to develop a Taxonomy of Digital Scholarship Activities in Libraries (TaDiSAiL) that provides a more in-depth look at these “meta activities” of digital humanities and digital scholarship in libraries. TaDiSAiL intends to foreground not only digital humanities, but also open research and library infrastructure.

A primary benefit of TaDiRAH is that it allows practitioners to discuss their work with colleagues and administrators in a clear and precise way, increasing shared comprehension across disciplinary and institutional boundaries. We aim to build a similar taxonomy of digital research activities that is specific to the work of librarians, scholars, and archivists who need to communicate their roles and responsibilities to administrators and funders. We hope that ease of communication about roles and types of work will increase advocacy and support for the digital work being done by/in libraries. As more institutions begin describing their work with the shared vocabulary of this taxonomy, practitioners of digital scholarship will be able to point to collegial examples as justification for increased support. Through the creation of this taxonomy, we also hope to identify areas of invisible labor and unseen connections between categories of digital research activities. 

In this panel, we will argue for developing a shared vocabulary for digital scholarship in libraries. This panel will consist of three short talks (about 10-12 minutes in length), which will leave ample time for audience discussion. The first talk will address the the history of TaDiRAH, and gesture towards areas where it could be enhanced for library work. The second will explain the need for this taxonomy and who may benefit from using it. The third section will outline our proposed terms for the taxonomy. While our version of the taxonomy will necessarily be incomplete, we hope to utilize the extended discussion time to solicit audience feedback about the taxonomy. In addition to taking audience questions, the panel organizers will use the audience discussion time to facilitate a structured conversation about the proposed taxonomy and generate ideas for its terms. It is our aim, by the end of the panel, to have an outline of a specific taxonomy for describing the work librarians do in digital scholarship endeavors, expanding upon the groundwork laid by TaDiRAH.

Treating collections as data in special collections libraries offers an unprecedented opportunity to promote the access, use, and reuse of archival collections. By opening our data we can offer new avenues of inquiry and increased opportunities for novel interactions. By encoding and interrogating data within our collections we promote new levels of access and invite innovative approaches to research and scholarship. By promoting the reuse and reproducibility of subject-specific data we can redefine authority.

As Padilla suggests, we can also use this opportunity to apply a critical lens to the process of collecting and classifying data; to examine the choices made throughout these processes. What structures of power are being reinforced in our metadata? What decisions are rendered invisible when we create datasets? Who gets to describe whom, on whose authority, and in whose interest? What are the implications of employing out-of-domain ontologies and controlled vocabularies in our work?

This panel explores these questions by bringing together practitioners from three fields: Library and Information Science, Digital Scholarship, and Assyriology. María Victoria Fernández, Assistant Curator for Digital Outreach at the John Carter Brown Library, will examine how problematic legacies of controlled vocabularies and descriptive practices can come to light when computationally analyzing metadata derived from special collections.  Émilie Pagé-Perron, Co-PI at the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative will consider reproducible research and Linked Open Data as means to mitigate the pitfalls of domain-specific classification in collections as data. Mike Zarafonetis, Coordinator for Digital Scholarship and Services at Haverford College, will discuss a special collections as data approach in a digital scholarship context, and its intersections with undergraduate research and co-curricular learning in the library.",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,We've updated our full proposal to better reflect the role of the panel in adding to the contemporary conversations on collections as data.

Launched in February 2017, the Labor WG is a volunteer working group formed to address a need in the field for discussion and guidance on ethical issues related to labor. These issues include the widely acknowledged (in)visibility of labor in libraries and the multiplicity of labor models used to build, maintain, and execute projects within digital libraries. Sub-groups are Valuing Labor, leading development of a valuing labor research agenda for library workers, and Contingency/Precarity, which advocates for humane design of grant-supported positions. At the 2017 DLF Forum, group members organized a panel discussion on Valuing Labor and hosted a working breakfast. Through 2017 and 2018, the Contingency/Precarity group has researched and developed draft guidelines for the creation of grant-funded positions.

Systems purchased for one project may be forced to work with less compatible material. And without in-house programmers, the evolution of these platforms can be out of our hands. We have to work within these confines, but it is up to us whether we consider them to be obstacles or opportunities.

This presentation will examine the restrictions we work within, the compromises we make, and the “dangerous freedoms” that can take advantage of us, by reflecting on experiences with three digital platforms. This includes a search for alternative methods of adding full-text searching to handwritten records in a PDF only platform (Digital Commons); struggles to balance the needs of stakeholders with the limitations and freedoms of CONTENTdm; and issues encountered when migrating to Islandora, especially those caused by the drunken enthusiasm of working with open source software.

Our team’s initial expectation was that we would focus on developing practices for the application and representation of RightsStatements.org statements for TRLN libraries’ online digitized collections. Through talking as a group, however, we realized early on that some of the stickiest issues regarding the implementation of a new rights management strategy involves the work an institution has to do to identify appropriate staff to do the work, allocate resources, plan, and document the process. 

Instead of developing a decision matrix for applying the RS.org statements in digital collections, we spent our time drafting a report – freely available on the web – that describes the following important components when implementing RightsStatements.org:
* roles and responsibilities 
* technical decisions
* example implementations

In this update, we will focus particularly on the vast divergence between the general job descriptions and the lists of specific duties and qualifications. We will also consider the question of how these roles are situated: whether the authority that they are given matches the strategic importance attached to them; whether we are seeing a resurgence of “Coordinator Syndrome” as was the case with library instruction coordinators in the 1990s; or if, as some postings appear, DH and DS postings are written as ""dumpster jobs,"" where even a unicorn has little chance of success. Besides documenting the development of these roles, this dataset evokes broader questions about  directions and priorities for library-based digital scholarship.",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2018--0600:00,2018--0800:00,0

As a result, there is a growing community of practitioners that contribute to digital practice in roles not strictly embedded in a single collecting institution. These roles often focus on facilitating collaboration between and among organizations. Panelists represent a range of perspectives on the growing realm of cross-organizational library work including: grantmaking, cultivating networks, and training and educating.  

The session will begin with short presentations from each panelist that provide concrete examples of cross-organizational work. The presentations will be structured to weave together reflections, observations, lessons learned and skills, methods, or tools that could align with or inform work in libraries, archives, museums, and related organizations. 

While the short panelist presentations will provide context, the session is designed to encourage large group discussion. Questions to seed discussion will include:
What does cross-organizational work mean for you? Which goals, initiatives and strategic priorities within your organization are coupled to cross-organizational collaboration?
What does successful cross-organizational work look like? Examples? Why?
What is the value of expanding our view of local challenges using what is sometimes referred to as “system-level thinking”? How do we cultivate “system-level thinking”?
How do we align organizations with competing motivations? How do we build trust? How do we generalize tools and solutions that originate in a single organization or domain?
How are we thinking about shared digital infrastructure together with local digital content stewardship? How do networks, communities and consortia advance these discussions?
How might grantmakers support, or improve their support of, cross-organizational work? What might they stop funding, either in the context of cross-organizational work or to make more room for supporting this work?

Panelists and moderator of this session intend to demystify cross-organizational work in order to  enable participants to:
Develop new perspectives on their personal practice and existing involvement with cross-organizational work
Initiate inter- and intra-organizational collaboration
Advocate for the value of cross-organizational work
Adopt cross-organizational engagement strategies to local communities
Identify relevant training opportunities 

At the end of the session, attendees will be challenged to report back on efforts to initiate new collaborations, advocate for cross-organizational work, adopt proven engagement strategies to local communities, or identify a training opportunity. Outcomes of this discussion will seed a series of open, virtual roundtable discussions that will provide opportunities for librarians to think together about the ways that cross-organizational work advances their professional mission.",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2018--0600:00,2018--0600:00,0

As trends in digital scholarship expand across the disciplines, particularly in the areas of digital humanities and computational social science, some have identified the library as a key player in supporting these new modes of research. Digital scholarship takes many forms, and this workshop will address the computational or algorithmic approach of text mining. During this workshop, attendees will be introduced to the concepts, tools, and methods used in text analysis. They will learn techniques for supporting text data mining research at their home institutions, including how to recognize text analysis reference questions and how to direct scholars to strategies and resources best suited to their inquiry. 

This workshop will use the tools and services provided by the HathiTrust Research Center, and its parent organization, the HathiTrust, as a lens for exploring methods and techniques for large-scale text analysis that moves beyond volume-by-volume access. The HathiTrust Digital Library contains over 14 million volumes of digitized text contributed by research libraries from around the world. Its size affords scholars the opportunity to increase the scale of their inquiry and to ask new kinds of research questions. The HathiTrust Research Center has developed a suite of tools and services for performing computational text analysis on material in the HathiTrust Digital Library. As such, it is a useful jumping-off point for learning about text analysis approaches and techniques, from building a research corpora to analyzing it with computational methods. 

This workshop will cover: 

> An introduction to text analysis and  tools and methods for performing text analysis
> How to gather, work with, and analyze textual data
> Techniques for supporting or partnering with researchers engaged in text analysis research

Through instruction, discussion, and hands-on activities, attendees will learn the full cycle of research activities for text mining so that they gain practical skills and understanding of  theoretical concepts useful for supporting and partnering in digitally-inflected research. The hands-on activities are designed to build foundational knowledge in text mining approaches and tools. In one sample activity, attendees will:

> Learn and practice basic command line skills
> Download a textual dataset from the HathiTrust Digital Library
> Run supplied Python scripts from the command line to extract text features
> Analyze their results via data visualization tools and scripts

Other similar activities will include learning how to conduct web scraping via Unix commands to retrieve text from webpages, and then formatting the retrieved web page text via Python scripts in order to clean and prepare the data for use in text mining tools.",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2018--0600:00,2018--0600:00,0

How would they move the collection from a dark city hall basement to FIU’s digital repository of scholarly and cultural digital collections? The project began with a SEFLIN grant which provided a digitization kit (flatbed scanner, digital camera, lighting kit, and more), as well as city and GNMHS funding. Staff included selected FIU curators, archivists, digitization experts, and metadata specialists. Some scanning was done on SEFLIN equipment in a spacious room provided by the city; however, it was found that the majority of 4X5 negatives required FIU’s Epson 10000XL scanner, and large-scale maps were handled on other FIU special equipment. The collection was hosted on FIU’s institutional repository, dPanther, a system based on the SobekCM software, a product of the University of Florida.

It can be used in a workshop setting to take participants through all the steps of building a digital library, from digitization and metadata creation to deploying an interactive and open digital collection site hosted on GitHub. This DLF Learn workshop will introduce the CollectionBuilder project, walking participants through using the tool and discussing the technologies, languages, and techniques that make it work. We will focus particularly on the pedagogical possibilities of the tool, exploring how it can be used to teach digital libraries concepts and digital literacy skills via hands-on, project-based learning. As a bonus, by the end of this workshop participants will be proud owners of a new online digital collection!

CollectionBuilder was created in response to the high infrastructure overhead of using Omeka, CONTENTdm, or other DAMS/CMS platforms for learning experiences. Although CMS feature familiar GUI administration interfaces, they are not simple to learn and customize, and their server requirements are a barrier to use in many settings. Users spend time learning a specific platform rather than exploring more generalized and fundamental digital library skills. In contrast, CollectionBuilder focuses on creating collections as data—after creating a well structured metadata CSV and directory of digital files, the tool generates a website for visualizing, browsing, and accessing the collection.  A project in ""minimal computing"", CollectionBuilder provides a depth of learning opportunities, allowing users to take complete ownership over the project and make their work open to the world. 

Participants in this workshop will be introduced to the following ideas and technologies:

- GitHub and Git basics
- Markdown content creation
- HTML, CSS, and JS literacy
- Jekyll and GitHub Pages basics
- Commandline literacy with Git, ImageMagick, and Jekyll
- GitHub collaboration and project management features
- Working in the Open: open source, open data, and collections as data

Participants will need: 

- A laptop with an internet connection
- [optional] a CSV from a digital collection with basic dublin core metadata
- [optional] a directory of images related to that CSV (less than 500 MB total)
- [optional] Ruby and Jekyll installed on their laptop for offline development

The workshop leaders (Becker and Williamson) presented at DLF 2016 on using Jekyll to develop their digital collections. CollectionBuilder comes out of that work, with the workshop’s focus deriving from their seeing a need on their own campus—after finding that the size and complexity of Omeka and other CMS-based systems often distracted from the desired learning outcomes (metadata literacy, image and document processing, visualization development)— for a lightweight digital collection building tool. Becker and Williamson are, however, currently using a customized version of CollectionBuilder to develop and maintain digital collection sites for the University of Idaho Library, and they will demonstrate how the tool can be used to deploy digital collections built from items hosted in ContentDM or Omeka.",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,This workshop could be two or three hours (or even one if necessary). ,,,,2018--0600:00,,0

In the past, curators and their student employees would scan items without any standard procedures for scanning specifications, file naming conventions, and digital storage. This was problematic as the curators were often unable to identify and reuse past scans leading to redundant digitization. Additionally, these images would not be made available online.  

Another unit in the library, Digital Initiatives, works with the curators in SCA to identify and carry out mass digitization projects for thematic online collections. The Cataloging & Metadata Services Unit then creates metadata and uploads digital objects making them accessible online. However, this process would break down when SCA received patron digitization requests which were often just a few negatives or one folder that had to be scanned in a relatively short timeline. Recognizing this issue, the three units collaborated to create a streamlined process to make patron-driven digitization requests available online. The result of their efforts is a workflow offering practical strategies for institutions of varying sizes and levels of access to technological resources. 

This presentation will describe the development of the workflow, address some of the roadblocks during the development, and discuss the collaboration between three units to make this happen.

In the first half of the workshop, we will work together to define the repeated elements in the primary source and develop a data dictionary. We will define what we collect and the standard format in which to collect it. We will work from a primary source on a collaborative google sheet. 

In the second half we will take this sheet and load it into QGIS, an open source mapping software and run basic analytics based on the inquiry from the first half. Participants will learn ways to visualize their data to reveal patterns hidden within the text. Participants will also be able to produce a quality map of their work.

The final step is to format a thesis statement using the analytics as a piece of evidence in the argument. This work fits into a traditional class and has the same end goal of a research paper.

In this initiative, we consolidated our consortial borrowing services with interlibrary loan and recall into a single request function. We removed duplicative e-resources listings from our interfaces. We created a software service that reads OpenURLs and prechecks our catalog for availability of a cited work. 

This project demanded that we make numerous decisions about how to build connections across our data sets and online tools that would enable our desired outcomes. Current discovery systems effectively function as a stack of data, logic, user interfaces, and request services. Opportunities for integration and simplification exist in each layer in this stack. Record sets can be consolidated. APIs can be queried. Services can be merged. But how do we evaluate these choices comprehensively, and make the best use of limited resources?

Drawing upon lessons from our recent discovery project, this presentation will offer an approach for comprehensively evaluating options for discovery architecture. How can we compare whether it is better to integrate two data sets through a record load or to develop software which bridges two systems using APIs? How can we provide service logic when our citations and record data are frequently inconsistent or incomplete? How can we communicate to users the logic and limitations of the system?

The project responds to Dartmouth’s history as a settler-colonialist institution founded to educate Native American students, its history of exclusion, and its late 20th-century rededication to Native American education. For the 250th anniversary of Dartmouth’s founding in 2019, librarians are working with students, scholars, and Native communities to interrogate the college’s exclusionist, colonial history in digital and physical environments. Laura Braunstein is the Digital Humanities Librarian at Dartmouth College.

The Digital Humanities Librarianship course at the University of Washington iSchool integrates multi-disciplinary research methods and technologies, introducing students to varied processes and resources used across the humanities. Students investigate relationships between collections, data, tools, and people in DH. Being able to communicate and collaborate within the library and across campus departments is vital, and students analyze how these relationships differ between disciplines. Students work with existing (often abandoned) DH projects to evaluate not only the content of the project, but also to determine how better outreach and collaboration could improve outcomes.  Helene Williams is a Senior Lecturer at the University of Washington Information School and a long-time academic librarian.

The UC San Diego Library maintains a group of five programs that collaborate to support our digital repository, associated scholarship, and digital humanities. As we improve our repository and support digital exhibit tools, we are engaged in outreach efforts to align our digital object functionality for teaching and learning. In order to realize these goals, the Library will need to bring together expertise in digital user services, digital humanities, data curation. Individuals will work together to influence choices in UI design, platform support, and the policies and workflows for flexible development and management of assets. Roger Smith is the Director of the Digital Library Development Program at UC San Diego Library and provides support for Preservation Services.

Launched in February of 2016, @mcgill_rare is a labour of love by a quartet of McGill librarians. Two years and 6,254 followers later, this social media initiative continues to reach the community while also unexpectedly impacting our relationship to each other, our collections and the library.  The team organically formed from the ground up, helping us feel empowered to share what we do and bridge the silos between classically front facing liaison departments and technical service departments of cataloguing and digitization. Collaborative documentation and consensus-based decision-making have been keys to making this initiative both sustainable and inclusive. By seeing our collections through each other’s eyes, we have developed a more critical eye along with a real pride in what we do. Sarah Severson is the Digital Library Services coordinator at the McGill Library and one of the founders of the @mcgill_rare Instagram account.

Digital Collections at the University of South Carolina serves six special collections units on campus and collaborates often to produce diverse, instructive collections.

Framing, organizing, and managing digital work into programs of activity that are interconnected and interdependent can help us achieve economies of scale, establish and maintain clear roles and responsibilities, evaluate and prioritize high-impact work, and advocate for the resources we need to institutionalize our efforts. So how do we build strong, sustainable, and adaptable digital programs? How can well-managed projects build the scaffolding for coordinated programs of activity? 

Organized by and featuring members of the DLF Project Managers Group, panelists will share their experiences moving from digital projects to programs in different areas, and discuss the challenges and opportunities these moves have presented within their organizations.

Digital Reformatting at the Ohio State University Libraries was formalized as a program of activity and combined administratively with a well-established Preservation program in 2011/2012. The strategic alignment of these activities has had many operational benefits, and (of course) a number of challenges. As the Reformatting Program matures, we are focusing on establishing digitization streams that allow staff and equipment to readily move between well-formed projects, continuous workflows, and on-demand digitization for time-bound requests. 

At Syracuse University Libraries, the progression from project to program is being defined in the liminal space emerging between grassroots efforts sparked by successful digital projects and an administrative mandate to support a more strategically understood digital library program. This presentation will focus on efforts to build a program in this space while recognizing how progress has been anything but linear.

The University of Michigan Library IT provides a variety of digital repository preservation and access services. Many of these digital repositories services are running in silos. There is an effort underway to these services running in silos to one program.  We see value and demand for bringing coherence to the services on the user-facing side and consolidating on to new and improved infrastructure on the technical side.  We are working on bringing these projects and services under the umbrella of one program for all digital repositories. 

Several years of rapid capacity building for digitization and digital collections at the University of Oklahoma Libraries included many diverse new projects and significant successes, from organizational improvements to new and updated platforms. This project approach is now uncoordinated and unsustainable for our mid-sized, mid-resourced academic library. Some cross-functional teams are moving toward a program approach; other teams are not convinced that this is necessary.

Through an in-person forum and subsequent research and practice outputs, the project aims to transform our profession’s analytics practice. 

The practice of third-party tracking on websites is widespread, and has only increased in prevalence and complexity over time. Libraries are furthermore increasingly partnering with third-party vendors who deploy analytics and tracking software. Analytics help tell a story of impact for stakeholders, while also serving a crucial role for tuning and improving library services. One prominent example of third-party analytics software is Google Analytics, a leading choice for web analytics in libraries. Google Analytics is easy to install and has no monetary cost, but from the perspective of user privacy, the cost can be steep. Google Analytics participates in a network of third-party tracking on the web that exposes user data, often without the fully informed consent of the user or the library. Libraries have historically offered safe spaces of intellectual freedom, yet the widespread implementation of third-party analytics may conflict with library commitments to privacy.

Our goals with this project were threefold. First, we wanted to engage critically with the corpus by identifying perceptible trends in content, tone, and authorship. Second, we wanted to learn digital humanities by doing digital humanities.

Specifically, it will document lessons learned from two forms of collaborative work with regional digital collections and contexts: the development of Our Marathon, a community project and digital archive of materials related to the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, from 2013-18, and a 2017-18 collaboration between students in Brown University’s Center for Public Humanities and the Providence Public Library Special Collections Department that centered on local use-cases for digitized collections concerning local history. In both projects, collaboration and dialogue with local stakeholders and audiences introduced questions that productively challenged and complicated our ideas of openness, the values we aligned with archival materials and contexts, and the realities of how local history is documented, read, debated, and remembered in digital spaces. Ultimately, this presentation invites attendees to consider where local interests and investments are present or absent in our investments in accessibility our approaches to collections structures, the design of our repository interfaces, the resources we afford to community outreach and collaboration at the levels of staffing, programming, communication, and instruction. It will also argue that a new or renewed commitment to the local does not necessarily need to happen at the expense of investments in national and global audiences, use-cases, and contexts.",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2018--0700:00,,0

material.

Many practitioners in archives and libraries feel that they are not prepared to provide access to born digital records, but providing access is an important service and a key advocacy tool for developing digital processing and preservation programs. For the administrator, access is a visible service to communities as well as a proof of concept for allocating resources to digital processing and preservation. For the archivist, leaping to this step helps inform and build stronger workflows for acquiring, accessioning, and processing this material.

Designed as an opportunity for practitioners and beginners to learn from one another, the
workshop will take a collaborative approach with a morning of group discussions on relevant
topics guided by workshop facilitators, followed by a hands-on afternoon with demonstrations
and usability testing of born‐digital access systems and breakout discussion sessions.

Topics will be selected through surveying workshop participants and through forum discussion
but will ultimately address how policies, copyright/risk assessment, user needs, reference
interactions, processing workflows, donor relations, advocacy, and other archival functions
affect how, when, and what we provide access to, with an emphasis on user‐driven access
throughout.

As part of this proposal we would like the participants to register in advance and if possible
survey them prior to the bootcamp on tools and skills they’d like to work on during the

Our field is overflowing with policies, implementation schemes, and preservation goals, but it is rarely obvious how to turn our goals into reality in terms of hardware and software. We rely on IT to make our preservation systems run, but this requires clear communication and translation between our very different fields of expertise.

On one hand, our goals and processes are invisible to IT. They ""only see data"" and are concerned with maintaining the entire infrastructure of servers, websites, platforms, and tools. At the same time their work is invisible to us. We learn enough IT terminology to handle what we're responsible for, but we often rely on them to ""make it work.""

Digital Imaging & Preservation Services within the Virginia Tech Libraries is building a comprehensive digital curation system that spans the entire data lifecycle. Library IT is working with us to implement our preservation policies, including their maintenance of our Archivematica instance. The ability to administrate our preservation software belongs solely to IT. We are working to improve the give-and-take between our unit and IT.

The Computer History Museum launched the Center for Software History to tell the story of software and the ways it has impacted society. To assist the Center, the archives needed to acquire computer workstations for processing materials. Archival staff collaborated with IT to establish responsibilities and a timeline. The workstations were completed, but not without challenges and compromises between IT expectations and archival needs.

The UCLA Library Special Collections Department embarked on a project in 2016 to implement Archivematica to process and package our born-digital archival material. This project relied on collaboration with our colleagues in Digital Initiatives and Information Technology who are responsible for centrally supporting library software. During implementation, difficulties ranged from competing departmental priorities, to the nature of open source preservation software, to a mutual unfamiliarity with one another’s expertise.

The University of Arkansas Libraries is in the early stages of establishing a digital preservation program. We are transitioning from an open-source system (used minimally due to a lack of IT resources and support) to a proprietary cloud-based system. The Preservation Coordinator also provides digital preservation services to a research center on campus where there are constraints of funding and storage space. Our goal is to collaborate, with everyone having the same understanding of preservation activities.

This panel aims to provide practical tips for maintaining strong, positive relationships with the people managing the systems that underlie our preservation work. We will accomplish this by suggesting solutions and techniques for improving communication between libraries and IT, including discussion of:
-Terminology and translation between preservation and IT
-Misconceptions about preservation
-How IT availability and expertise informs digital preservation systems
-Challenges of communicating the importance of preservation to IT, stakeholders, administration, etc.
-Tool and technology case studies

The conflict between library values and protecting our community members
Informing our patrons about the risks of social justice work
Identifying common methods of harassment to lessen their impact
Tools and tips for documenting harassment when it happens

The two departments are in different stages of implementation (Scholarly Communications Initiatives is a work in progress, while Digital Collections is more established), but both had the same goals of increasing student autonomy and roles, freeing up librarians to focus on higher level projects and QA review, and creating more efficient processes. This presentation will address key expectations that guide student employment practices, highlight types of work suitable for students and the associated documentation needed to effectively delegate responsibilities, and discuss UNLV’s strong emphasis on co-curricular benefits of student employment. 

Scholarly Communications Initiatives (SCI) is a small department that relies heavily on student employees, where they assist with metadata creation and entry and special projects. Looking towards the future and with an eye towards increasing efficiencies, SCI has borrowed from other libraries’ shared practices (including UPenn, Montana State, and Loyola Marymount), and initiated a new training program for students and created a workflow that supports the ongoing compilation of the UNLV Author Bibliography (a comprehensive yearly list of all types of faculty scholarship). The department had several goals, including increased student autonomy and responsibility for metadata entry, increased departmental capacity for identifying and soliciting open access articles for the bibliography records, and to shift staff workload to quality assurance and minimize staff time spent on metadata creation for UNLV Bibliography entries.

Digital Collections is often the department tasked to carry out time-sensitive or externally-funded Special Collections and Archives projects requiring managers to be flexible and confident in applying skilled workers to key priorities. Building on twelve years of experience growing the department through these type of projects, student employees have become central to the timely completion of high-profile projects and are typically hired, trained, and working independently within one month of hire. Student positions handle a range of complex tasks such as capture during reformatting with a camera system, interpretation of the department’s metadata application profile to assign metadata, and inventory and digitization prep for several outsourced projects. These high level tasks cannot be effectively delegated without communicated job expectations, clear instructions and procedures on each step of the workflow, and the support of a dedicated student supervisor who attends to all aspects of the student’s success.  

The panelists will be Christina Miskey (Citation/Bibliography Assistant), Kelsey Lupo (Student Supervisor & Lab Manager), Andrea Wirth (Scholarly Communications Initiatives Librarian), and Cory Lampert (Head of Digital Collections). They will highlight the changes made in each of their departments, what they have learned along the way, and what adjustments have been made since initial implementation.

This panel will present five situated practices in higher education, responding to the following set of questions: How might our pedagogical work re-imagine the connections between civic education and digital learning as a collaborative, citizenship-building effort? How might we teach courses, lead workshops, and design curricula to transform academic knowledge-making along ethical and radically democratic lines? What are the sites and materialities of digital civic engagement that can help disrupt the neoliberal impulse to decontextualize education into market-based training and feel-good service-learning? What are the stakes in civic education and digital learning, particularly as connected to power and privilege inequalities along the campus-community spectrum? Audience participation will be welcome throughout the discussion.

Heinbach encourages civic engagement in students through first-year information literacy education. She aims to illuminate issues of power in information creation and access as well as empower students to seek knowledge in order to improve their lives and communities. She partners with disciplinary faculty to develop student research projects that democratize information through contributions to Wikipedia and has integrated digital tutorials about government information into the first-year experience curriculum. 

Locke’s work focuses on developing curriculum that equips students with critical digital and data skills that are valuable for democratic citizenship. Course activities and projects are designed to impart skills and critical thinking regarding topics such as effectively using open data, critically engaging and analyzing government data, and data storytelling.

Mulligan has taught information and media literacy as part of advanced writing seminars focused on developing the analytical and rhetorical skills necessary to be active citizens involved in advocating for public policy changes. The evaluation of media and political rhetoric was required throughout the course to engage argument and influence stakeholders. He is currently working to adapt these approaches into library-hosted workshops.

Patel’s work focuses on developing and supporting academic initiatives for students, faculty, and community partners that enrich their projects of cultural and digital citizenship. Through undergraduate teaching and partnerships with colleagues in the Library and wider campus units, his feminist bridge practice aims to address the challenges of community-engaged learning and public humanities work in the digital age around such methods as digital storytelling and place-based community archiving. 

stringer-stanback focuses on how we as librarians embody the tenets we seek to teach. How do we critically engage with our society and the injustices we see (and some of us experience) daily? What are we doing at our universities & institutions to promote robust intellectual discourse? Oftentimes words like “diversity” and “micro-aggressions” have been co-opted and watered down. It is imperative that we not only teach our students, but it's also challenge ourselves to step outside our comfort zones as well.

Google Analytics and anecdotal evidence from librarians were initially used to identify problem points in navigation and retrieval. Major issues included positioning the digital collections landing page several clicks down from the library home page, text-heavy “image” carousels and collection descriptions, and a retrieval system that does not capitalize upon item-level metadata but instead relies on an outdated database with limited descriptive terms for each collection. Wireframes addressing these pressure points were then created and presented to the larger digital library program for approval. In the coming months implementation of the approved wireframe for the home page will begin. In addition, a pop-up web survey is being submitted for IRB approval that will get further information from users on their search needs. In particular, we hope to learn if users have a preference for item or collection-level retrieval so we can optimize the updated system for this approach to search.

Built upon the Samvera (formerly Hydra) technology stack and co-developed at Indiana and Northwestern Universities, Avalon was designed as a standalone solution bundle.  With the support of a generous grant from IMLS, the Avalon team is working on a number of fronts to better integrate Avalon into the wider Samvera community, make Avalon easier to adopt for those with limited local support, and provide for better integration between repository and archival considerations.

This panel will focus on three main areas: Collaborative development, preservation workflow integration, and a recent SaaS pilot presented by the partners working together to achieve these goals.  Artefactual, a recognized leader in digital preservation, Lyrasis, an innovative digital libraries services provider, and Avalon Media System team members from Northwestern and Indiana Universities will provide a history and status report of our progress.

The first front focuses on Avalon’s collaborative development with Hyrax, pairing and creating a sustainable model for both the Hyrax solution bundle (a Samvera out-of-the-box repository front end) and Avalon 7. As the Avalon team contributes on Hyrax sprint cycles, we are also re-architecting Avalon as a set of specific components that can be applied either as stand-alone constituents for any Hyrax implementation, or as a fully featured repository bundle.  Avalon 7 will also provide IIIF support for AV materials, benefiting Hyrax users, while new features developed in Hyrax benefit Avalon. 

A second focus includes digital preservation workflows for Avalon users supported by integration with Archivematica, an open-source digital preservation system from Artefactual Systems. Archivematica provides preservation services such as file format identification, validation, characterization, metadata extraction and format normalization. This partnership will deliver workflows enabling preservationists to make available items from archives or send content to a preservation solution of their choice.

This presentation will also focus on the pilot project on which Lyrasis collaborated with Indiana and Northwestern in the Fall/Winter of 2017 through early 2018. During the course of this pilot, Avalon was deployed in an SaaS environment for nine partner institutions that spanned a diverse range of use cases and institutions types. As part of the pilot project, documentation of a variety of partner use cases was created, including what went well and challenges encountered by partners. A list of features and extended functionality was created and vetted by partners, with a prioritized list being generated as a final outcome of the project detailing recommendations to make Avalon align more closely with the needs for institutions interested in using Avalon as a SaaS in the future.

Additional Avalon efforts include community building in the wider digital library community via regular webinars, social media and electronic communication, seeking co-development opportunities and a fostering a community of librarians and users who can lean on each other.  In addition, Avalon has participated in and will continue to support Samvera governance and other shared efforts toward developing a more sustainable technology ecosystem.",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2018--0700:00,,0

Additional assessment work was performed with vocabularies used for <type> and the definitions for the <type> element gathered from both local collections and external metadata application profiles and metadata schema.
 
The team concluded that there is no single agreed upon definition for <type>, nor a predetermined vocabulary that meets the Library’s needs. One of the main issues that these findings highlighted was the confusion between <type> and <genre> as defined and used by different institutions and implementations. Additionally, since each digital collection may have many different types of resources, it would be nearly impossible to have one vocabulary that meets the needs of varying levels of granularity. Although a system that supports a hierarchical metadata structure for <type> vocabularies, rather than a flat structure, could alleviate this issue, development of such a system poses its own challenges.

In this snapshot presentation, I’ll dive into one such solution that the University of Virginia Libraries has recently undertaken that has proven to be a success worth emulating.

As the University of Virginia has transitioned to being a regional service hub that aggregates and provides content to DPLA, the questions of how best to receive content, and how to provide it to DPLA had been one without an obvious answer.  Solutions have tended to involve consolidating content into some uniform metadata repository and using a standard harvesting approach such as OAI-PMH.  After careful assessment of everyone’s needs, an solution with unexpected simplicity was selected.  The GitHub service proved to quickly and inexpensively fill the role of the metadata repository while git and the Github API worked together to meet the needs of harvesting or change propagation.  We easily built validation hooks to empower metadata librarians to set the rules (using Schematron) for aggregated metadata.  I’ll discuss what we got for free, what we had to build, the risks we anticipated, and the results we achieved.  

In the end, I’ll compare this success with other examples where we evaluated whether generic, widely-used products could meet the needs that have traditionally been filled by library-specific technologies or communities.",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2018--0700:00,,0

Endangered Data Week is a collaborative effort to shed light on public datasets, records, and documents that are in danger of being deleted, repressed, mishandled, or lost. The week's events promote care for endangered collections by publicizing the availability (or lack of availability) of datasets, increasing critical engagement with data and government records, encouraging political activism for open data policies, and the fostering of data skills through workshops on curation, documentation and discovery, improved access, and preservation.

Conversations between members of the DLF Government Records Transparency/Accountability Interest Group and Endangered Data Week hosts have revealed a central challenge to EDW work. Participants noted that they faced difficulty integrating key components of EDW—data consciousness, civic literacy, and governmental transparency— into their workplaces. Obstacles come in many forms, and include a lack of support from supervisors; unfamiliarity with models for incorporating core EDW ideas and values into instruction, collection, and other services; and a lack of resources for integrating this work into their practice. This workshop will focus on these areas, and will bring together people from diverse positions in digital librarianship to discuss the strategies that have worked or failed for them.

Attendees will:
-learn approaches to EDW programming, events, and the development of resources
-discuss the various meanings of “endangered data” and consider what data consciousness looks like (or what it might ideally look like) in specific institutional/organizational contexts
-learn about and share resources that have been developed for EDW and related initiatives
-explore needed or existing resources for open data advocacy, risk awareness, and civic literacy
-brainstorm and begin to develop new materials to add to to the existing open EDW toolkit

Outcomes for the workshop include:
-EDW organizers and hosts will develop a stronger sense of who might wish to participate in future events, and how to develop EDW programming to serve their needs and interests
-attendees will walk away better prepared to host or facilitate an EDW event or an event similar in scope
-attendees will better understand how to advocate for data-focused work in their workplaces

The data should be portable and extensible so we could use it in other contexts.  The new model should make our workflows easier and more straightforward.

We developed metadata schemas and rebuilt our front end from the ground up.  Our data lives in an eXist database, with Drupal providing the user experience.  We upgraded our CONTENTdm instance to the responsive version, then tied it all back together.

This model has been reasonably successful: collectively, hundreds of organizations participate in a dozen networks dedicated to preserving not just subscription e-resources but also government information, web archives, digitized special collections, theses and dissertations, and more arbitrary repository content. We have a notion, though, that LOCKSS is not doing as much good for digital preservation as it could be, and getting there will require changes both to how we engage communities and how the the technology works.

Our coupled community and technical strategy is to make LOCKSS more accessible and interoperable for broader use in general digital preservation workflows by cross-pollinating with allied open-source software communities; engaging the LOCKSS community in collaborative software and solutions development; documenting LOCKSS technologies and more actively fostering an integrator community; elaborating shared and distinct competitive strengths in partnership with other community-based digital preservation service providers; and creating a structured forum for partners to guide the evolution of the LOCKSS Program itself.

The overarching, animating use case for this effort is LAMs’ need (1) to engage with  computationally-driven inquiry - whether research, teaching, or assessment - and (2) to develop appropriate environments for doing so, in the form of datasets, services, and approaches (including different staffing structures). 

As those who have undertaken this work can attest, serving collections as data represents something of a sea change: we have, after all, carefully developed user interfaces over decades that enable scholars to ‘flip’ through digital objects in a controlled environment (without walking away with any files). Shifting to a Collection of Data paradigm compels attention to the potential of computationally-accessible collections and to the shape and nature of both collections and data. It demands a different understanding of stakeholders. And it requires libraries to align our principles and values with the particular requirements of the work. The Collections as Data effort represents an attempt to reconcile the need for shared definition and understanding with the heterogeneity of institutions and their collections, staffs, resources, and tools.

In this capstone presentation, project team members will introduce the concept of Collections as Data and provide an overview of the projects’ activities and impact, including demonstration of the toolkit and framework. We will also speak about next steps, some of which will hinge on DLF community engagement. We are proposing a panel with all six members of the project team, as a way of conveying the 2-year-long conversation that shaped the effort alongside its products (which range across personas, case studies, statements of shared principle, and a culminating guide to collections as data work).",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2018--0700:00,,0

In an effort to move a collection into the digital age, many organizers choose the path of least resistance, opting to make their archives available quickly and for a low cost. However, when preserved and presented poorly, a digital collection fails its audience, and too often, years of research may be hindered instead of helped.  Critical to the success of a digital research archive is the combination of accurate data with a well-architected search solution. 

Low-quality data or software does more harm than good, often costing more in retroactive labor to create a functional resource for community engagement and research. Inexpensive software not optimized for a collection often leaves researchers struggling. Poor metadata or OCR conversion means relevant items are overlooked and rendered invisible. The true cost of choosing economy over quality is the lost time of researchers, the repressed search results, or the technical debt required to fix issues that arise as the collection is utilized.

Anderson Archival discusses what an archivist should consider when creating or updating a digital collection, when not to choose economy over quality, and the various ways in which a digital collection can fail to be a useful research tool as a result of substandard work.

These hubs, in turn, expose their aggregated collections for harvesting into the nation-wide Digital Public Library of America (DPLA). Bringing together such a diverse array of digital collections while accounting for their respective software platforms, descriptive schemas and access restrictions is no small task. At the same time, the aggregated hub model has been so successful that many of these regional centers find themselves dealing with hundreds of thousands or even millions of objects at a time. Efficiently harvesting and normalizing this vast “bumper crop” of heterogeneous content with limited resources requires a unique approach to technical and administrative hurdles.
 
Metadata aggregation presents a smorgasbord of challenges: movement of large numbers of files, sense-making of patterns and anomalies, precise validation of critical elements, among others. Wayne State University has been working on an application named ""Combine"" to support these activities and facilitate the preparation  of metadata bound for the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA). Graham will share some of the discussions and considerations that shaped the design and data model, and some of the successes and difficulties faced along the way.

The University of Virginia Library is currently transitioning from a record-provider-only DPLA Content Hub to a more technically active Service Hub. As such, Jeremy & Mike will be discussing a workflow they are testing that leverages the Github commit process and API for partially automated metadata submission to DPLA. He’ll also cover a custom XML schema with embedded schematron rules which performs baseline metadata assessment and validation. 

Like University of Virginia, CDL is currently in the process of moving from a DPLA content hub to a service hub. In addition to aggregating and pushing content to DPLA, they also expose records via Calisphere, a well-trafficked portal to California culture and history in its own right. Matthew will explore the various challenges of harvesting and providing access to a large body of ever-changing content, including metadata updates and normalization procedures, and dealing with more esoteric data formats/transmission protocols beyond the OAI-PMH standard. He will also share a preview of a service network meant to ‘fill in the gaps’ with content from under-resourced institutions.

Unlike many other DPLA service hubs, MWDL uses vendor software to aggregate content from 16 hubs in 6 western states, presenting unique challenges and opportunities for metadata normalization and harvest. Since joining DPLA in 2013 as one of the original service hubs, the profile of MWDL’s membership network has shifted, with members moving away from 3rd party solutions to open-source solutions and even home-grown ones.

These issues go beyond the National Forum Grant specifically or even grant-funded work more broadly (though the stricter framing of a grant-funded project may lend itself to this sort of design and reflection). A ubiquitous model in libraries assumes that we can raise important issues, move change forward, or find a common solution by assembling expert opinion and soliciting feedback and input from “communities” - communities of practice or participants who represent certain groups. However, the development of a community in which all participants have an equal voice, and the roles of “expert” and “community member” are blended into an authentic partnership, is easier to plan than accomplish.  

Anecdotally, projects are designed without access to public analysis of how other efforts have structured engagements-- and why they have done so-- and whether those designs worked. This panel seeks to move our profession closer to a critical discourse of engagement, to focus our profession on other traditions and diverse areas of knowledge and expertise that hold important lessons for our work. These include community organization, participatory design, action oriented research, and political activism. A panel at the DLF Forum will allow us to share information that might otherwise only be disseminated through word of mouth (or in closed or scattered social media exchanges), information that hints at the governance and decision-making models baked into projects. How did our teams approach community engagement approaches and strategies? How did these approaches serve the goals of the projects? How might the work of activists and community organizers inform our design? How resource-intensive were our community engagements? Where did we have to adjust our approaches to match the realities we encountered or to better align with projects’ values?

The presentation includes a brief history and literature review of digital community projects in Europe and the US and the attendant politics around establishing expertise and authority where community is often offered as a more authentic binary opposite to the monolithic institution. This historical examination serves as a backdrop to interrogating the rise of the digital library platform as a tool of community heritage engagement, and how the politics of inclusion are woven together with digital libraries in the designation (or not) of being a library.

The standard approach to digital access to early books for scholarly and other users continues to duplicate online the experience of paging through a book (typically a page‐turner interface) and reading through its descriptive record (a metadata presentation).

Additional information opens the works to different questions. Metadata can include ownership history, multiple works bound together, the presence of annotations or binding waste, illuminations, volvelles, watermarks, and so on. In addition, some key visual information is not commonly gathered. Two examples are text-block edges and watermarks. The digitization is not technically difficult and in fact is quite cost-effective to add to routine digitization.

Images of the same object (or page) taken at different times, perhaps years apart, or with different equipment or different lighting, form a data set that can be of very high interest to researchers as well as to conservators and preservation staff.

The presentations will be followed by a facilitated discussion around how to best optimize the benefits of these resources for our communities of practice and how to strategically sustain momentum for ongoing resource development intended for public release. 

Working group presentations will feature the following:

(a) The Cost Assessment working group will discuss incorporating user-centric design into ongoing Digitization Cost Calculator development; (b) The Cultural Assessment working group will present updates on its Rubric of Reflection framework, which features the public-facing Selection Workflow Framework as well as two initiatives-in-progress: an inclusive metadata resource and a running registry of “diversity” efforts influencing cultural assessment in digital collection creation; (c) The Metadata Assessment working group will share updates on projects including the Metadata Application Profile (MAP) Clearinghouse, a metadata analysis tools repository, an updated workshop on metadata assessment and analysis, and a metadata quality benchmarks initiative.

Sharing infrastructure is a core tenet of TDL’s model, so the storage function of digital preservation promised to have the most collaborative impact. Storage comes at the end of the digital preservation workflow, however, and members have struggled with readiness -- prioritizing, processing, and preparing content for storage becomes a major bottleneck. These bottlenecks can frustrate DDP storage networks, which are eager to build up a sustainable base. As a node of DPN and Chronopolis, an AWS user, and an implementer of DuraCloud, TDL needs dedicated technical expertise in each. TDL must also support its members’ local programs with consultation in order to ameliorate the bottlenecks. 

In one year since revitalizing TDL Digital Preservation Services, we have found that balancing the needs of members with our obligations to the larger community presents challenges, as work given to one constituent base is often invisible to the other.

There is data on what publications are bought, sold, and downloaded; there is even data on what is read, but little attention has been paid to what is taught on a large, systematic scale. Syllabrowser aims to bring the trends and projections of taught knowledge to the fore while providing a valuable tool for instructors to select and diversify course content. 

On a pragmatic level, Syllabrowser is a course design tool which will help instructors select readings in an informed and systematic way. Leveraging a structured database of content, Syllabrowser can search and parse existing syllabi by subject, course length, page length, etc. Currently, an instructor teaching a new class or a class outside of her expertise might poll colleagues over social media for suggested readings.  With Syllabrowser, she can draw upon thousands of syallbi that have been collected, categorized, and tagged, to build a syllabus that not only caters to her interests but reflects her values by facilitating searches for underrepresented voices or open access content.  

On a critical level, Syllabrowser is interested in two things: the continual evolution of knowledge institutionalization and tracing its development. Scholars interested in understanding the history of their respective fields can examine how certain texts or authors have risen or fallen out of favor over the years, trace theoretical trends according to geography, institutional setting, or range of years, through a number of data visualizations.",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2018--0700:00,,0

The content in the geoportal has been aggregated from dozens of institutional repositories and government data portals. This presentation will provide an overview of our evolving techniques for harvesting, extracting, and normalizing metadata and why our model has changed over time.

At the outset of the project, we established a uniform workflow to harmonize all incoming records to a single geospatial metadata standard, ISO 19139. However, this workflow was ultimately deemed too rigid and has since undergone numerous updates to prioritize retaining descriptive metadata over a strict compliance to a standard. 

At the heart of this evolution has been a growing understanding of what users need. Through usability testing, we realized that just because a metadata record validates in a given standard, it does not necessarily contain sufficient information for a user. For example, a metadata standard might require multiple contact names, but not essential information such as codebooks or spatial reference systems. Furthermore, we found that normalizing deeply nested XML files is labor intensive and does not alway produce the best results for consistently formed discovery metadata. Finally, metadata transformation scenarios frequently feature information loss.

As a result of this changing outlook, we iteratively updated our workflow to emphasize the creation of higher quality discovery metadata along with external links to contextual documentation files in their original metadata standard.",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2018--0700:00,,0

As higher education, and libraries specifically, jumped into the IR lake, pond, volcano? With both feet, mission statements were crafted around this idea of capturing and preserving the scholarly output of institutions’ faculty, staff, and students. Creative output also gained traction as content that had a logical home in the IR. Nearly 20 years into the IR movement, libraries are grappling with the identify and function of these repositories and one particularly sticky question is the whether or not the IR should be the for archived records of the institution. At Utah State University (USU), a simple decision tree guides the process of determining whether content should be placed in the IR or in the Libraries’ Digital History Collections with the primary question being “was the material created by USU faculty, staff, student or department?” Typically with the institutional archives, the answer is “yes,” but that does not fully capture nuance of the material and the discussion. 

Yearbooks, presidential papers, and student newspapers are all examples of collections that according to the tree would be added to the IR, and yet, much of this content was instead added to the DHCs. One reason is that this content is seen as having a high level of community interest and (local, state, regional) historical significance, and therefore it should be destined for the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA). In 2014, DPLA made the decision to no longer accept IRs for harvest making DHCs the only vehicle for this content to get to DPLA. Functionality of platforms, metadata standards, and usability are just a few of the other factors that go into these increasingly complicated conversations about where institutional archives should (digitally) live.

The time to begin considering if a projects is achievable, ethical, and sustainable is before starting, rather than assuming that those considerations can be tacked on at the end.  While good documentation is important for projects, projects can lead to operational workflows or practices. The same forces that cause projects to vary so much are more slowly reshaping workflows, so having good documentation is important to accurately reflect what work is being done, how the work is done, and who is doing the work.

While European modernist typographic artifacts from this period are regularly preserved and studied, this American western modernist tradition remains almost unknown.
 
Reno’s early twentieth century neon signs reflect the city’s dual identity as both frontier outpost and thriving, modern center for liberal entertainment. Approximately 30 of the existing signs from this crucial period remain standing in downtown Reno, but are at risk of demolition in the current climate of rapid downtown development, making this a particularly time-sensitive project. Material relating to Reno’s neon signs is spread out across several Nevada institutions or held by private collectors.
 
This project aims to digitally preserve existing signs created from 1931-1960 through photography, creation of two-dimensional vector-based renderings of the signs, and geotagging. In addition, it will digitize, centralize, and make freely available the dispersed materials relating to Reno’s neon sign tradition in a cohesive digital archive. All material in the archive will link to its home collection and the location of the sign it relates to, thereby providing important connections with local cultural institutions and landmarks.

While LSC employs a Digital Archivist, the responsibility of stewardship of born-digital materials cannot be feasibly maintained by just one person. Until 2017, LSC archivists focused their efforts on paper-based materials, simply reporting the presence of digital materials to the digital archivist via a survey. Their knowledge of how to approach born-digital materials varied from zero experience to others who were up-to-date with scholarship, but still lacked hands-on, practical experience. It is for this reason that LSC archivists have participated in a born-digital archives study group. The study group was designed to help LSC archivists learn about born-digital best practices and engage in hands-on exercises to prepare themselves for processing digital materials.

Libraries are no longer working within information-scarce environments. Privacy concerns are spurring a change in the paradigm with which libraries are collecting patron-related data.

The 2016-2018 CLIR postdoctoral fellow cohort yielded a white paper outlining best practices for the use and preservation of 3D artifacts, among other topics. The 2017-2019 cohort aims to add to their work by thinking through how to integrate 3D technologies and methods within libraries for various outcomes, i.e. teaching, research, and learning. 

 The CLIR postdoctoral fellows come from disciplines as wide-ranging as computer science and literature, and can provide diverse perspectives on 3D applications within university settings. Moderated by Lorena Gauthereau, this session will provide brief glimpses of the work each member has done with 3D technology, from workshop preparation to long-term projects that use game engines, such as Unity. Individual presentations will address use of 3D at our own institutions, critically assessing a range of tools necessary for AR/VR, 3D modeling, game generation, and art production. Emma Slayton will address pedagogical approaches to 3D and data visualization at Carnegie Mellon University, and her attempts to connect disparate resources to cultivate teaching and interaction with 3D on campus. Jessica Linker will discuss using 3D technology to reconstruct and interrogate historical spaces, as well as her attempts to generate blended historical/digital pedagogy for students working on the History of Women in Science Project at Bryn Mawr College. Chris Young will examine the technological inclusivity of the Unity3D engine using computational methods and critical theory, which has become a prolific tool for aspiring 3D artists and game creators. Alex Wermer-Colan will share his experiences working with VR as a tool for interdisciplinary classes visiting Temple University’s Digital Scholarship Center, as well as his collaborations with Temple librarians to create a VR learning module for primary source literacy with their Blockson Afro-American Collection. Eric Kaltman will comment on the preservation of 3D/VR applications based on archival research conducted with the Entertainment Technology Center at CMU and current trends in software preservation. Finally, Neil Weijer will comment on the various implementation strategies and audiences for existing 3D projects and identify common strengths and perceived limitations, which can serve as starting points for a discussion of how to expand the impact and longevity of 3D projects.

We hope to provide attendees with several possibilities they can consider when adopting 3D technologies at their own institutions. We likewise hope to raise important questions beyond the technical application of these tools -- for example, how does using 3D shape our understanding of gender, race, and class? Collectively, we will consider the benefits and drawbacks of various 3D technologies as tools, bringing attention to thematic connections between our individual interests and projects, while gesturing toward what constitutes best practice.",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2018--0700:00,2018--0700:00,0

In 2017, CMU’s Digital Science, Humanities, Arts: Research and Publishing (dSHARP) center began through the co-sponsorship of the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences and the University Libraries. dSHARP’s core team are library faculty from a variety of backgrounds. Beginning with a modest budget, but no dedicated space or technology, dSHARP has sought to foster a campus-wide interdisciplinary community of practice. Due to divisions between the colleges and programs of CMU this initiative has faced many hurdles. 

In this 20-minute session, we will discuss how these challenges have shaped dSHARP. These include promoting research support to a largely-siloed institution and the increasing demands on liaison librarians to become familiar with (much less use) a variety of digital tools and methodologies. The need to provide support instruction to a broad range of departments and librarians has proven to be critical to fostering interest in library support such as digital toolkits across disciplines. 
 
Collaborations, new staff, and expanding beyond DH have been key to advancing the center. Hiring new staff who offer data visualization and software curation expertise has also uncovered new demands and revised old assumptions. Strengthening departmental relationships by identifying key faculty and staff proved instrumental in guiding new developments that furthered interest. We will also discuss plans to evolve our center, and offer recommendations for those also promoting libraries as research partners.",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2018--0700:00,,0

Islandora Enterprise (ISLE) utilizes a set of Docker images to orchestrate an Islandora 7.x stack and keep its systems and services current, secure, and running with minimal effort. By design, ISLE separates an institution's data and customizations from its core systems, moving core components into Docker images. This simplifies and automates installation and maintenance for Islandora/Fedora environments. Individuals, institutions, and communities of practice all benefit: ISLE is an automated, reliable, redundant, and secure way to immediately use the Islandora stack to its fullest potential. ISLE continues to develop into a robust Docker ecosystem, introducing features and options that otherwise would require expert configuration.

The workshop will introduce the mechanics of ISLE, and use it to spin up a full Islandora 7.x stack (documentation and friendly ISLE teachers included).Participants with a wide variety of skill sets will be welcomed and supported in hands-on work with ISLE. Anyone who works with installation or maintenance of Islandora, people from small institutions with Islandora repositories, and folks considering migrating to Islandora are especially encouraged to attend. During the workshop, participants will find themselves engaging with other members of the community on a number of topics including future growth of ISLE to enhance features and deepen documentation. Participants need not have development skills to attend, but do need attention to detail and a willingness to follow instructions for working with the command line. A laptop is required. We will provide a positive learning environment.

While the workshop will focus on building a local development environment, ISLE also delivers a set of services and systems that are resilient, and ready to run a full Islandora stack to the highest production standards. For institutions considering migrating from a proprietary digital repository to a Fedora-based open source digital repository, ISLE offers an appealing jump-start alternative to manual installation of Islandora or other similar systems. For institutions already using Islandora, ISLE is expected to cut maintenance costs in half and improve overall security.

Social media companies are increasingly feeling intense scrutiny for decisions they make around the data that they store, and how they use those data. The data that academic libraries control and touch are, conceptually, much like social media data: they are capable of creating intimate portraits of patrons' interests, thinking, research, and professional and personal social networks, and is worthy of the same level of scrutiny.

Librarians have long imposed this scrutiny on themselves, from a shared sense of professional ethics and in the face of potential data leaks, subpoenas, and National Security Letters. The DLF Technologies of Surveillance Working Group, the ALA Privacy Checklists project, and a 2018 LITA webinar series on protecting privacy with patron data all reflect this internal focus. This year, some institutions are also feeling new external regulatory weight, as from the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which requires being able to enumerate and delete data about individual patrons upon request.

As a step toward facilitating transparent conversations with its patron, university, and institutional communities about data analysis projects beyond what Institutional Review Boards and other regulators require, the University of Pennsylvania Libraries have been developing several new tools for presenting policy and related documents to patrons, and for frequently updating patrons on practices within the Libraries.

The recent proliferation of street art in these neighborhoods, and the ephemeral nature of street art, inspired University of Nevada, Reno librarians to partner with local art organizations and street artists to create an online archive, exhibit, and virtual reality (VR) experience. Using widely and freely available technology, the Libraries assembled a team that photographed the art using 2D digital cameras, and captured 360 VR footage of the art and of several artists creating interior and exterior murals. The team conducted on-camera interviews of street artists in Reno; collected permission forms; generated metadata; preserved the images and created an archive and exhibit. This archive, accessible to students and community members, supports scholarly research in urban street art but creates ties with the local community.

Public art reflects the culture and personality of the community in which it exists. Often, the artists are local inhabitants whose works create a sense of community and pride. Libraries are important entities within neighborhoods and can provide the resources needed to digitally preserve the artwork created around them and by their patrons. 

What we will teach:
The workshop will provide details about the workflow, equipment, software, manpower, and community outreach involved in creating and implementing a project similar to the Reno Street Art archive and VR experience. 
Since this is a hands-on workshop, we will not focus on teaching how to create the VR component of the Reno Street Art project but will instead encourage attendees to utilize existing tools to create their own public art archive.
Attendees will be broken into discussion groups to brainstorm their own digital cultural-preservation projects using tools and platforms already available to them.
Attendees will learn how to create an online public art interface using images and video on the Google Earth platform. 

Technology requirements:
Attendees will need to bring a laptop with Google Earth downloaded onto it.

Learning outcomes:
Consider ways to reach out to communities to gain support (and permission) to archive public art.

This presentation will share one attempt to build LOD infrastructure within the context of a university library: the PeriodO project (http://perio.do), which has established a linked data gazetteer for authoritative, explicit spatiotemporal definitions of named spans of time (that is, historical, archaeological, geological, or art-historical “periods”).

The fieldwork, research, and scholarship that went into the creation of this publication took place between 1975 and 1998. While the finished book exists today as a physical volume, the work that supported the publication employed different kinds of early digital technology and is quickly reaching obsolescence. In addition, the ICA has plans to make this volume, which has existed for the last 20 years in print only, more widely accessible with a digital, online version. We approach the task from within the theoretical framework of Rothenberg and Rosenthal—emulation provides more complete access to at-risk digital artefacts than migration alone.
We implemented different environments using MacOS 7, Windows 3.1, Pagemaker and dBase, in the recovery of historical datasets and in re-producing the book in its original design software. The challenges we encountered included technical barriers and questions that arise whenever working with intellectual property. Most notably, we encountered the complexities of re-producing text using proprietary fonts in ancient languages.

The bulk of the workshop will then be dedicated to the how-to of strategic planning in the digital preservation realm.

Digital humanities represent a conceptual and practical framework for understanding digital curation. Known as an interdisciplinary methodology, cross-disciplinary projects have emerged from the interaction of humanities, computer science, and virtual environments. It nonetheless requires establishing protocols, recording methodologies, and developing documentation throughout the research process to allow replicable research. Using digital humanities as an umbrella term (Yakel, 2007) demonstrates that academic disciplines do not operate in isolation. While interdisciplinary work presents many opportunities for digital scholarship and curation, it also presents new epistemic challenges (Krohn, 2017). As libraries seek to engage in digital humanities initiatives, how do they provide the depth of contextual knowledge in support to interdisciplinary work, which in turn could lead to successful projects with respect to pedagogy and research? It is also important to integrate the output of digital humanities within the digital curation lifecycle; however do libraries have the skilled talent to commit to interdisciplinary work on the front end? Similarly, is there a skill shortage for analyzing all the data that surface from the very rich cross-disciplinary work in social science, humanities, and science?

The goal of this workshop is to provide librarians with a foundation of knowledge from which to design privacy curricula or services specific to the needs of patrons at their own institutions. 

Practically oriented and hands-on, the session will introduce participants to the use of digital privacy tools, but more importantly, will help participants build an understanding of what threats to privacy exist in various scenarios, and how to choose the right tool and strategy (or combination of tools and strategies) for a given scenario. 

Learning Outcomes for Participants:
-- Be able to explain to patrons, colleagues, and community members how privacy benefits everyone in a free society, including people “with nothing to hide.” 
-- Understand how surveillance threats -- both digital and analog -- differ according to the gender, race, sexuality, and poverty or occupational status of the surveilled.  
-- Understand differences between corporate and government mass surveillance, and between mass surveillance and targeted surveillance by either government or individuals. Understand differences in strategy for mitigating each of these types of surveillance.
-- Understand how freely available tools (e.g. password managers, tracker blockers, Tor, VPNs, encryption tools like Signal, anti-surveillance search engines and browsers, etc.) can be used to mitigate particular privacy and security risks, and when to recommend each to patrons. 
-- Understand strategies for mitigating privacy risks when traveling through U.S. border-entry checkpoints. 
-- Become aware of trusted sources for further learning. 

In our discussion of tools and strategies, we will start with low-barrier options that anyone can apply to daily workflows improve privacy and security. Then, we’ll move on to options that people with greater risks may want to consider. For example: 
-- Scholars and students who may be targeted for harassment due to their academic work, political writing or activities, and/or their racial, sexual, or gender identities. 
-- Researchers who communicate with members of vulnerable communities via social media or other digital methods are concerned for the safety and anonymity of these communities. 
-- Researchers and students who need to maintain their own anonymity while conducting digital research.
-- People who travel internationally.

The workshop will be taught by Paige Walker, digital collections & preservation librarian at Boston College, who has led privacy workshops for teenagers through Girls Who Code and is completing an MS in Cybersecurity, and Eliza Bettinger, digital humanities librarian at Cornell University, where she has implemented a series of well-received privacy workshops for faculty and students.

Postdoctoral and contractual positions are becoming more frequent in academic libraries (Clark, 2017), and as such we need to reflect on the important roles these scholars play at their institutions. 

This panel will explore the roles of one set of contractual laborers, post-doctoral fellows, and invite conversation on the ethics, gender disparity, and pressures of post-doc positions in the academic library. Topics to be covered include: training and professionalization, contributions to the library and credit for work, the shift from dissertation to library work, establishing cross-institutional standards, and how short term contracts can affect commitment and quality of work.

Panelists are all currently employed in contractual positions, and will provide short introductory thought pieces on the following topics to inspire conversation:

Kim Martin: Building Community in THINC Lab
Two years ago I was hired to build the DH Community at the University of Guelph, and to help create THINC Lab, a new DH Center in the library. Though both largely successful initiatives, much of this success depends on my being present in the space, or via the web, to ensure things run smoothly. I will discuss how having short-term contractual labour fill this post-doc role makes community building difficult and present some strategies for others in my position.

Hannah Alpert-Abrams: Postdoctoral Laborers
Postdoctoral laborers is a group of humanities scholars working in postdoctoral positions with some labor component, including teaching, digital humanities, or librarianship. Together we have been compiling information about current practices across institutions, and working to identify standards for postdoctoral positions that can help lead to non-exploitative, mutually beneficial working conditions. I’ll talk about what we’ve learned from this work and where to go from here.

Heather Froehlich: Going “alt ac” in academic libraries 
PhDs are trained to be experts in a very small, very narrow slice of a larger discipline, often making us a wildcard in academic libraries. We therefore are potentially disruptive to academic libraries’ ongoing outreach and engagement goals, as we are not necessarily fluent in information studies when we arrive for a non-permanent position. Thinking about what general expectations for both sides could look like, I will offer some ways this transition can be made more explicit for both the host library and the postdoctoral researcher.


The panel will wrap up by attempting to answer some questions from previous literature on Post-docs in the Library, including:
Has the attempt at creating “a new species of digital scholar-librarian” (French et al., 2005) been successful? 
What is the primary role of the post-doc? Is it research, as Clark (2017) suggests?
Do we feel the “perception of inferiority” (Bryson, 2004) of post-docs by our colleagues still exists?
What’s the goal? Are we being trained for alt-ac or post-ac positions (Sayre et al., 2015), or to continue to hold out for the ever-elusive tenure-track job?",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,"If accepted, we will reach out to see if one or two more post-docs might be interested in taking part, with a particular effort made to diversify the panel participants.",,,,2018--0700:00,,0

Wax is both a Ruby gem with useful tasks and a Jekyll theme. Among other tasks, the gem allow producers to generate IIIF manifests from a group of image files, and baseline markdown files and YAML headers from CSV files. The theme combines these elements to produce a full blown collection/exhibit site with advanced search, image viewer, metadata display and the flexibility of open web creation of a static site generator. The resulting static site allows us to reduce costs for maintenance and security—in effect storing fully functional websites in virtual storage servers. With the reduction in cost, new collaborations have become possible with faculty and students. Because of the careful balance of the plain-text approach we have also been able to add Wax to our pedagogical toolkit. In this presentation we will illustrate Wax with two examples: the forward-migration of Columbia's Barbara Curtis Adachi Bunraku Collection, one of our most complex collections; and the Style Revolution graduate course in art history, where students learned the range of competencies needed to be able to build a mature digital collection and exhibits around a collection of plates from the world's first fashion magazine held at the The Morgan Library & Museum.",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2018--0700:00,,0

Why does Amazon recommend I order kitty litter and toys at the same time for a prompt two-day experience? We, and our patrons, routinely engage in systems that predict, recommend, and speculate about our interests based on the digital fingerprint we provide with our link clicks and “likes”, but we all struggle understanding how and why those systems work as they do. Part of this struggle is recognizing how our technological experiences are increasingly mediated by algorithms - the code and computational processes embedded into our software. Recent work by scholars, such as Dr. Safiya Umoja Noble, has shown how algorithms exhibit implicit racial or sexist biases and reify societal prejudices. Moreover, the technical nature of algorithms and the lack of transparency surrounding them can be a challenge for novices. The goal of this workshop is to create more informed instructors with a better understanding of internet feedback loops who can bring awareness of the implications of complex formulas guiding our technological world. Our Montana State University team, with grant funding from the IMLS, has conducted research in order to develop a white paper, a web-based teaching tool, and a standard curriculum to support the teaching of ""Algorithmic Awareness"": an understanding around the rules that govern our software and shape our digital experiences. During the workshop, we will be teaching participants first principles around algorithms and their definitions, how to identify common algorithms in software experiences, and the implications of algorithms in shaping our world. This workshop will address three primary learning outcomes, allowing participants to: comfortably define algorithms while drawing upon common online interactions to support their personalized instruction; learn how Algorithmic Awareness as a concept fits into the ACRL Framework and can be promoted as a form of digital literacy; design a local instruction plan for teaching about algorithms at their institutions. Additionally, individuals may reuse grant deliverables (which will be released as Open Educational Resources) as learning modules and have a chance to ask about pedagogical uses for these modules. The goal of the session will be to create actionable steps for teaching about algorithms in their own information literacy instruction. The target audience are professionals such as librarians or professors who can subsequently act as a resource to teach students about the implications of algorithms in hopes of a more transparent relationship with technological experiences. However, any participant with an interest in learning how algorithms mediate aspects of our digital experiences and an interest in understanding the invisible rules and processes embedded in our software will find value in the workshop and our discussions.

For librarians, digital information overabundance cuts two ways: at the same time that vast quantities of mediocre, incorrect, or deliberately manipulative information is aimed at our patrons, similarly vast quantities of highly accurate and detailed information is being collected about them, mostly without their knowledge. These two phenomena do not exist in isolation, as information collected about individuals is often then used in order to more effectively tailor messages back to them. (See Cambridge Analytica for just one example.) 

If we think of privacy literacy as understanding how information is collected about individuals in the digital environment, and how to shield one’s information from collection when desired, how can librarians develop privacy literacy among their patrons? What kinds of instruction or other interventions might be most effective? 

To approach an answer to these questions, I’ve begun a study of academic-library patrons to better understand what they know about how the Internet works, what surveillance risks they are vulnerable to, and what they most want to know about privacy and surveillance.

However, library professionals continue to struggle to be viewed as partners in the instruction and inquiry aspects of digital scholarship partly due to challenges with digital skill development. We are often introduced to tools in a “one size fits all” approach where workshops, training, and skill development are often designed around an idea of a single set of core competencies for supporting digital scholarship without an acknowledgment of disciplinary differences in research application. Participants often feel as if time is wasted in a workshop learning a tool that that seems irrelevant to their disciplinary concentration in the library.
 
Here we propose a liberatory framework for skill development in digital scholarship among library practitioners. We apply the concept of boundary objects (Star & Griesemer, 1989), often used in analyses of organizational information flows, as a framework for conceptualizing skill development for a heterogeneous practitioner environment. Under the boundary object framework a particular digital tool may have a variety of applications within a library-supported digital scholarship environment. All of them are valid. For example, a tool such as a GIS platform may be used differently according to discipline, skill level, or research question.

In practice, due to the administrative constraints of student submission, the PDF becomes the anchor of these digital packages, a fact which allows libraries to integrate complex digital work into our existing systems of access and description. While a digital project may live online, the PDF component of a digital dissertation is the most discoverable and accessible part of the work in library databases and discovery tools. Recognizing this, we wanted to ensure that the information about the digital components of a dissertation were included in the accompanying manuscript, with the added benefit of providing usable traces of a digital project for future researchers, should anything go “missing” in the digital package.

What is not always visible is that when decisions are made for one attribute – such as file formats – those decisions affect other knowledge management objectives.  For instance, “More Product, Less Process” is a method that promotes making collections available more quickly with less focus on granular organization and description to reduce backlogs and improve access. While this approach is more scalable and sustainable, it tends to make items less discoverable, which may create hidden collections. Practitioners regularly encounter similar dilemmas when implementing digital preservation, and the optimum balance between conflicting objectives is not always clear. Many digital preservation frameworks do not reflect the subjective tradeoffs that real practitioners have to make. These tradeoffs are required in order to create sustainable digital preservation approaches. This presentation introduces a new framework by which archivists, librarians, and preservationists can think about the multidimensional nature of their decision making. 

The Gold (AU)DRIPSS framework comprises the principles of Accessibility, Usability, Discoverability, Reproducibility, Interoperability, Preservability, Scalability, and Sustainability. These principles address many of the facets involved in a digital preservation strategy, and an individual institution’s ideal strategy may prioritize different factors based on their needs and environment as the strategy matures and evolves.

As Librarians know, people often have the same name, change names, and have names represented in different ways. ORCID keeps our identity and work from being confused with that of others.

Publishers and grant funders increasingly require ORCID iDs to submit articles and apply for grants. Given the way these external forces often drive ORCID usage, Librarians tend to focus on researchers and faculty as the core audience for any ORCID promotional strategy, and tend to partner with Offices of Research and Public Relations / Communications. This approach makes lots of sense for automating institutional repository workflows, making faculty more competitive grant applicants, and highlighting faculty research and achivements.

Outside of a mandate, though, these efforts will likely not saturate institutional culture to a significant extent. In this presentation, we will discuss unconventional allies and approaches to ORCID promotion.

What if they were portable, worked offline, and could be emulated in any web browser? Emerging web application architectures that enable offline modes, cacheing of data, and rendering of web apps within any modern web browser are becoming widely supported. These Progressive Web Apps (PWA) have tremendous value for our own digital library architectures. PWAs use advances in offline storage, metadata manifest files, and Javascript functionality to store data and create software interfaces that can act like native device applications and work in common web environments. They allow us to create once and publish everywhere. More importantly, PWAs use the most ubiquitous, open technology platform, the Web, as their primary means for distribution and display. In this session, we’ll consider the common patterns of Progressive Web App (PWA) models as well as the changes and implications these models have for digital library design, software architectures, and metadata. We’ll look at how a PWA methods can be applied to a digital library by grounding our work in an implementation. Our case study will be the MSU Library Channel, a digital video library that has been rewritten as a PWA. Our goal will be to try to understand the PWA development model and why PWAs will help the “archiveability” and emulation of our digital libraries.",1,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2018--0700:00,,0
