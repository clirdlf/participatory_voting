We’ve aggregated documentation for 200+ digital collections into a central, shared repository. We’ll share how we did this, what we’re documenting, who has access, and why it was important to collaborate with internal and external stakeholders.","Institutional knowledge needs to be documented in a shared space, not kept in an individual’s head or location only accessible to a single person. At the University of Michigan, we’ve aggregated all of the digital documentation for about 200 digital collections into a single online environment in order to increase our shared organizational knowledge and for better, faster access to documentation needed throughout a digital collection’s lifecycle. This information is critical to our upcoming platform migration.

When a digital collection used to be created, it was enough that the collection itself was available. Over the past 3 years, we have captured the who, what, when, where, and how relating to each and every digital collection. In many cases for the older digital collections, we had misplaced or never had a lot of needed information. I’ll share how we dealt with this issue and how we changed our workflow for creating new digital collections to prevent this issue in the future.

We made decisions about the digital environment and its structure based on who, internal and external, needed to access the documentation and when during the digital collection lifecycle. I’ll share how we considered user access and controls during implementation.

This documentation work is part of the assessment of digital collections on which we presented two years ago to the DLF community. We hope to share our workflow and approach in hopes that we can collaborate with others as they consider their long-term organizational needs around documentation for any digital project.","Institutional knowledge needs to be documented in a shared space, not kept in an individual’s head or location only accessible to a single person.

","Members of PA Digital, DPLA’s hub in Pennsylvania, will take you through their process of migrating over 400,000 metadata records from over 80 institutions in legacy software to a new aggregation system, Shoofly Pie.","PA Digital, DPLA’s hub in Pennsylvania, developed its first aggregation software in 2014. Since its launch, PA Digital has expanded significantly. More than 80 institutions have contributed rich collections to PA Digital, allowing us to curate primary source sets for educators on topics such as the labor movement in the steel industry, students protest, Quakers and the abolitionist movement, and women’s suffrage. We began the project harvesting mostly from CONTENTdm, but as interest and participation grew, we adapted to harvest from systems such as Bepress, Islandora, Omeka, Samvera, and VUDL. With each new system, modifications to our software and extensive troubleshooting were required. Further, Metadata Specialists had no flexibility to transform or validate metadata, so contributors had to make adjustments locally. It became increasingly cumbersome to efficiently make Pennsylvania’s unique collections available through the DPLA. It was clear we needed a new, more sustainable system.

PA Digital’s Metadata Specialists partnered with developer staff to create personas and user stories, draft functional requirements, and explore new systems to aggregate, process, and review metadata at scale. The team looked beyond library software systems and decided on Airflow, an open-source workflow management platform. PA Digital’s implementation of Airflow calls XSLT and Schematron scripts from GitHub, stores data in AWS, indexes in SolrCloud, and pushes data onto OAI-PMH servers and into a Blacklight interface (funnelcake.padigital.org).

This presentation will give an overview of how the workflows and system, named Shoofly Pie, functions as a flexible and scalable metadata aggregator.

113,Virtual 2020 DLF Forum,45-minute Panel,"Henry, Charles","CLIR, United States of America",,DLF at 25: Maturing Digital Libraries. The Continuity of Essential Resources,,"infrastructure, scholarship, sustainability, crisis",I/we agree to share this submission under a CC-BY 4.0 license.,I/we agree to share this submission under a CC-BY 4.0 license.,,,,,The lack of sufficient infrastructure and continuity of support for digital scholarship and its products has reached a point of crisis.,The lack of sufficient infrastructure and continuity of support for digital scholarship and its products has reached a point of crisis.,"

One definition of maturity is the ability to respond to the environment and know when and how to act according to current circumstances and broader societal needs. The Digital Library Federation has always sought to invent and realize the means for universal, sustained, transformative access to the content of libraries, archives, and other cultural heritage institutions as a shared effort across institutions and active engagement across the ever-growing, ever-developing profession.

The digital library concept 25 years ago-- a vision of seamless access to vast quantities of content--was at first a technical undertaking, that then proved to be much more, capable of transmuting organizations, practitioners, research, teaching and society. This 25th anniversary is an inflection point, and an urgent one.

Concurrent with DLF’s 25th Anniversary, the National Endowment for the Humanities, The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and the American Council of Learned Societies have begun a national conversation that will purposefully address the endangered persistence of essential digital projects integral to the humanities and social sciences. The lack of sufficient infrastructure and continuity of support for digital scholarship and its products has reached a point of crisis.

The current problem has several recognizable sources. Over the past quarter century, the environment of higher education in which most digital libraries have been developed has been competitive, with funding focused on individual, distinct projects, and a propensity at colleges and universities not to incorporate digital library costs into operational budgets once external funding has ceased. These circumstances have often produced digital libraries as incremental projects, as a series of digitization and technical efforts additive to the pre-digital library world. Some of the most prominent digital libraries, considered indispensable by scholarly disciplines, remain fragile with an uncertain future.

The 25th anniversary is thus a moment to reflect upon the enormous accomplishments of the previous decades and to consider where we have potentially the most to gain from re-visioning, from re-prioritizing, from re-allocating; from stronger, broader, and new modes of collaboration; from new or different investments and developments. It is a moment to consider where the fruits of our work are endangered by unsolved problems or unresolved policies. It is a moment to imagine an expanded, healthy, re-imagined, and attainable digital library future, and to consider the strategic directions to achieve it.

Two plenary panel presentations are proposed. In the first, a group of distinguished participants and leaders involved with DLF and digital library evolution over the past decades will discuss key ideas and challenges they have experienced to help frame the current crisis of sustainability. The proposed speakers include Donald Waters, Wendy Lougee, Brett Bobley, and Charles Henry. Moderator: Carol Mandel

A second panel presentation will bring together current leaders and thinkers who are positioning the mature, integrated generation of digital library implementation. They will help initiate an agenda that can respond to the crisis of sustainability. Speakers will include Jennifer Garcon, Tyler Walters, Kate Zwaard, and William Kilbride. Moderator: Geneva Henry

In this presentation, Patrick Wallace of Middlebury College and Jessika Drmacich of Williams College will provide overviews of how each institution coordinates the collection of email for their respective college archives. Highlights include how to build consensus in support of email preservation, diversifying the record by collecting a multitude of voices, and community building. The presentation also covers: (1) why email archives are important for representing diverse voices, (2) ways to build relationships with IT departments and record creators as collaborators using personal archiving methodologies, (3) the complexity of collecting email, failed workflows, and different techniques for email archiving, and (4) ways to provide access to preserved email.

Successful advocacy and policy development is necessary to begin email preservation efforts, but complicated; implementing a practical email preservation program requires negotiating between many different stakeholders, who often have conflicting interests, biases, and risk models.
In this presentation, Patrick Wallace of Middlebury College and Jessika Drmacich of Williams College will provide overviews of how each institution coordinates the collection of email for their respective college archives. Highlights include how to build consensus in support of email preservation, diversifying the record by collecting a multitude of voices, and community building.

Datasets aggregated at the individual level often interest social science scholars, yet such data poses a risk of identification and create an ethical dilemma for curators.

While some types of information and data are legally protected, other social data, such as home mortgage files, voter registration files, and tax parcel records are public and are often augmented with modeled indicators, such as religious belief or personal income, that may not represent the reality of people's lives. Library information and data specialists must develop infrastructure, workflows, and policies to ensure the ethical stewardship and use of these datasets. This interactive workshop will explore the tension between making purchased data as widely accessible to researchers as possible, while also ensuring that sensitive data is not abused.

Following a short discussion of some of the above challenges, we will introduce participants to technologies and workflows for data de-identification. Covering basic principles of data management, this workshop is comprised of hands-on activities in which participants will create redacted samples of data that maintain research integrity and usefulness. Learning outcomes include:

Develop fluency with generating random samples in order to make analysis with large files more manageable

Know how to assess the identification risk of specific variables within a dataset in order to protect the identity of human subjects

Create a Jupyter Notebook workflow that enables cleaning, redacting, and sharing data for research use

Learn some fundamental Pandas features for exploring, cleaning, and transforming data

This workshop will offer hands-on training in instructional design practices for emerging technologies in 3D visualization. Participants will also have the opportunity provide valuable contributions to the collaborative, open resource for digital library pedagogy in immersive technologies (AR/VR/XR), described in the forthcoming #DLFteach cookbook call for participation. This workshop will be led by members of the Digital Library Pedagogy working group (#DLFteach).

This workshop will consist of two segments, each providing the opportunity for hands-on development of digital pedagogy practices using 3D technologies for a wide range of purposes, from cultural heritage projects to distant learning. Because 3D technologies are emerging and in-flux, hands-on testing and critical discussion of their application is necessary to develop standards comparable to other forms of digital pedagogy. The first segment will introduce participants to digital pedagogy for immersive technologies as workshop facilitators lead “road tests” of lesson plans under development for the #DLFteach Toolkit 2.0 project. After participating in these road tests, attendees will have the opportunity to reflect on the instructional design principles incorporated into these lesson plans and provide feedback for improving them. This format builds on the success of our previous experiments in flipping the model of instructional design workshops. As demonstrated in our 2018 Learn@DLF workshop, we have found that by leading with teaching demonstrations, we can provide participants with a practical perspective on instructional design. Participants will review the exercises and will receive reviewer credit in the forthcoming #DLFteach Toolkit 2.0.

The second segment will develop additional learning outcomes and assessment techniques for immersive technologies. The segment will begin with an introduction to these two phases of instructional design, then move to small group discussion and collaborative development of AR/VR/XR lesson plans. Prior to the workshop, participants will be provided with models of learning goals and comprehension checks developed by #DLFteach members.

We anticipate the following learning outcomes:

1) Participants will understand immersive technology best practices as they relate to instructional design, including developing achievable learning outcomes and measurable assessment techniques

2) Participants will learn techniques and scenarios appropriate for incorporating immersive technologies in the classroom.

3) Participants will gain familiarity with common immersive technology tools/techniques and learn how to teach with these resources in an inclusive, accessible way

While participants do not need prior experience with immersive technologies, this workshop will focus on how to teach with immersive technologies, not how to use them. Besides A/V equipment, this workshop will ideally involve the use of VR headsets. In the case that facilitators can’t bring the VR headsets, we will still be able to test the lesson plans using computers.

Due to copyright restrictions on most twentieth and twenty-first century literature, innovative approaches are increasingly necessary for advancing the collections as data movement and the scholarly fields of cultural analytics and digital scholarship.

Temple Libraries have been digitizing underrepresented works of post-WWII “New Wave” science fiction, developing a cross-departmental workflow to ingest the scans and OCR’d text into HathiTrust’s repository for preservation and curation. This process required evaluating gaps in HathiTrust’s holdings and developing a local, adaptable model of digitization, ingestion, and exhibition. The project is expanding to include collaborations with Texas A&M Libraries’ and Kansas University Libraries’ special collections in science fiction, with plans to diversify the institutions involved in the grassroots digitization effort, including non-member libraries of HathiTrust and international partners.

The HathiTrust Digital Library is a collaborative, large-scale repository of texts accumulated through the mass digitization of research library collections, and as such, reflects the traditional collecting practices of those institutions. Like many organizations, HathiTrust is reviewing its systems, operations and practices to rectify ongoing inequalities addressed by social justice movements like Black Lives Matter. As we move towards greater inclusion of underrepresented voices, materials, and genres in our digital collection through more intentional acquisition, we are exploring new, coordinated digitization and ingestion workflows that balance scale and sustainability with equity and value.","This presentation explores a collaborative digitization project between Temple University Libraries and other Special Collections with holdings in mass-market science fiction, aimed at leveraging HathiTrust Digital Library’s infrastructure for data preservation and curation.

With Miriam Posner’s call to “come up with better ways of investing in people’s long-term potential as scholars” in mind, Leigh Bonds developed a professional development program to provide disciplinary librarians opportunities to attend immersive workshops in digital scholarship. Those participating in the program could choose from workshops that provide a general overview of the digital scholarship methods and tools; a subject-specific overview of methods and tools; or intensive training on a specific method, tool, or topic. The executive team approved a pilot program (2019-20) to focus on digital humanities, funding eight librarians in the arts and humanities liaison cohorts, special collections, and area studies. During the pilot year, the minimum requirements for participants included developing at least one annual goal related to digital scholarship, joining the campus DH Slack channel, and participating in the fall University Libraries’ Digital Scholarship Forum.

Minimally, Bonds anticipated these workshops would enable librarians to identify either research projects or course assignments that could be enhanced by using a digital method/tool. At most, she thought they would prepare her colleagues to collaborate with researchers on projects, collaborate with faculty and graduate students to integrate digital scholarship instruction and projects into courses, and/or develop their own digital projects. With six participating in the pilot, the program proved transformational: each participant benefitted from having intensive workshop experiences to not only delve deeply into the method(s)/tool(s), but also develop close connections to broader networks of colleagues and practitioners. Participants attended DHSI, UPenn's DREAMLab, HILT, Princeton’s Slavic DH Summer Workshop, ARL's Digital Scholarship Institute, and the DLF Forum’s pre-conference workshops. Each successfully integrated their learning into their librarianship, and began generating new ideas around collections and discussing those ideas across the organization. On their own initiative, the first cohort formed a bi-weekly working group to support one another as they integrated DH methods into their librarianship and scholarship. Based on these successful outcomes, the Libraries’ management committee approved a two-year extension of the program, expanding it to ten participants that include librarians from the social sciences and sciences.

This panel will provide an overview of the program and its outcomes, providing conference attendees with a potential model for building capacity for DS support at their own institutions. Bonds will outline details about the program—including participant requirements and costs—and discuss the ripple effect the program has had across the organization. Three participants will then share the experiences of those from their respective areas and discuss the program’s impact on their librarianship and scholarship: Courtney Hunt will represent participants from the arts and humanities liaison cohort; Jen Schnabel, special collections; and Ann Marie Davis, area studies.

We call these workshops “Storytelling Fellows,” and in them, graduate students learn to make digital stories or podcasts in which they tell the story of their research. In these workshops, aside from learning new skills and preparing stories for varied audiences, the students also benefit from making connections with other graduate students and developing their creations in a workshop environment. Storytelling Fellows is very work driven and community based.

In response to a growing interest in TEI, or text encoding, on our campuses, we took an online professional development workshop on how to encode and create digital editions of texts with the TEI standards. The workshop that we attended was good--and it met its own goals--but after having taken it, we couldn’t help but to wonder what a TEI workshop would look like in the Storytelling Fellows design that we’ve developed and come to trust. In particular, we wanted to design a workshop that would be much more project-based, learner driven, and conducive to people making connections, not just with teachers, but also with cohort members.

In a presentation, we would give some background about the Storytelling Fellows model before laying out how we used that framework to design a fun, interactive TEI workshop. We would also be able to relate how our design worked and what revisions we look to do upon further iteration.

The March on Milwaukee digital collection (https://uwm.edu/marchonmilwaukee/), housed at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, documents Milwaukee’s civil rights history, including protests, boycotts, and legislative battles against segregation and discriminatory practices. The efforts of activists and opponents are extensively documented.

The Roz Payne Sixties Archive Project (https://rozsixties.unl.edu), hosted by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, is named for the noted activist, photographer, and filmmaker, who died in 2019. The site features her collection of underground newspapers, leaflets, flyers, posters, photographs, and newsreel films.

Uptight and Laid-Back: Iowa City in the 1960s (https://dsps.lib.uiowa.edu/sixties/), hosted by the University of Iowa, recounts the experiences of a Midwestern university town through the use of photographs, alternative newspapers, flyers, recorded sound, and motion picture film, including a documentary recounting a 1967 protest.

Then, Christina Drummond, Data Trust Program Officer with the Educopia Institute, will present a collection of ethical frameworks, processes and tools that could guide data trusts and digital libraries as they look to leverage usage analytics.

During the community watch parties, the presenters hope to facilitate a discussion of how publication usage data (not just for books) could be ethically used, or potentially abused by digital library stakeholders. Participants will also be asked to consider what principles and protections should govern such data trusts that serve the scholarly community.

Ultimately, the changes inspired by new use cases and the collaborative work required to customize the tool expanded the role of partner from contributor to co-developer.

Librarians at the State Library of North Carolina initiated the development of a “multi-collection” option for CollectionBuilder’s CONTENTdm skin, which allows creators to pull objects from multiple collections when curating a digital exhibit. At the New College of Florida (NCF), the CollectionBuilder skin was modified to interact with SobekCM Repository’s API and build exploratory interfaces on top of existing collections. Additionally, feedback from the tool’s pedagogical use at NCF has refined its capacity to teach data management and web development concepts.

We will detail the benefits and deliverables that arose from this iterative and collaborative style of development, highlighting the ways that cross-institutional modifications are worked into the CollectionBuilder template so that they anticipate and aid customizations by future users.

How to do so substantively and coherently while acknowledging real logistical constraints? We propose to describe and reflect on an experiment we embarked on last fall during a semester-long undergraduate fellows program, placing our experience in the broader context of digital pedagogy. Taking a cue from “What is a computational essay?”, Stephen Wolfram’s 2017 blog post, we generated our own Computational Essays, interrogating and defining just what that might mean along the way.

The resulting projects make use of Observable, a new JavaScript notebook platform, and are inspired as much by code studies as by the code notebooks prevalent in science pedagogy, not to mention Miriam Posner’s often-cited digital humanities capstone assignment. The Computational Essay here serves as a central, flexible tool imbricating code and prose, a single artifact in which HTML text, executable scripts, and their outputs appear without apparent hierarchy privileging one over the other.

Students had the semester to consider a topic of interest and find a corresponding dataset, and through trial and error, engage both visual and discursive narratives “in” the data as well as observations “about” the data. Shuttling between issues of representation, standards, infrastructure, code, and rhetoric, students had the opportunity to wrestle with major themes of the fellowship. Our presentation will outline our approach and explore the ways the Computational Essay might be used as a critical, playful mode of encountering code.

","Digital Humanities (DH) projects are complex with multiple moving components in need of preservation. Early preservation planning for each component is a strategy for long-term access. This presentation will break down various components of a DH project, preservation approaches for those components, packaging methods for future recreation/emulation.","Digital Humanities (DH) projects have multiple moving components that each require their own preservation strategy. Projects begin with some form of data (text, images, csv files), that evolves into planning documentation (grant proposals, wireframes, productions plans), which leads to the project site (HTML/CSS). It can be overwhelming planning to preserve an entire interactive website as one entity. This presentation outlines our approach to breaking down a DH project into individual components, applying a preservation method appropriate to its content type, and then packaging each component together for long-term storage.

This approach relies on emulation over migration to address format obsolescence. Since each component is a unique format, and all of the components are packaged together, file format migration would be performed manually. This is not a scalable method. By planning for emulation and reconstruction of a website, we can develop a streamlined workflow for appraising, packaging, and preserving content. For this approach to be effective, documentation for each component is critical. Documentation is a driving force behind successful emulation to capture not only the technical components and decisions, but to establish a clear understanding of the goal and purpose of the project.

This presentation is the result of a test case performed on a current DH project to export and appraise the content and supporting infrastructure, apply individual preservation methods, and reconstruct the project from those components. This aligns with the conference topic Project management as we are providing a potential workflow for producing preservation-friendly DH projects.

Every migration of digital collections presents its own set of challenges unique to the institution and the platforms involved. Digital practitioners must think creatively and develop innovative solutions to overcome these challenges. This panel goes beyond offering migration strategies and encourages digital practitioners to undertake large-scale work on digital collections by re-framing migration as an opportunity for transformation rather than an obstacle to overcome. Panelists will share experiences with migration involving Islandora, CONTENTdm, ArchivesSpace, Knowvation, and in-house built digital content management systems. They will specifically speak to how they have taken advantage of migrations to advocate for additional resources, collaborate within and across institutions, evaluate usability, overhaul metadata, and otherwise optimize their digital collections.

Each presenter will begin with “two truths and a lie” about their migration story and poll the audience. This will create a space for both presenters and audience members to discuss missteps, failures, and sacrifices inherent to the migration process. Presenters will showcase how these lapses shouldn’t be covered up, but instead utilized for the enhancement of the repository.

These presentations will provide the basis for a discussion with the audience on concrete strategies for advocacy, effective collaboration, user research, and stakeholder management, in addition to broader inspiration to tackle transformative change.

We envisioned shared, collaborative leadership: a “production” leader responsible for process management and infrastructure development and a “community” leader responsible for education, outreach, and scholarship -- and we continue to work patiently and collaboratively to make this vision a reality. Most importantly to us, our driving ethos throughout the review was re-creating the program as more than reactive: it should have its own ambition, agenda, and stated values.

Pregnant parents who carry a fetus with a prenatal diagnosis have data tracked from birth to adulthood. Data includes highly sensitive information about parents, obstetrical outcomes, and children; therefore, robust privacy measures are put in place to protect participant identity in this research. The project complexity requires appropriately managed identifiers to link data from multiple clinical systems. This data is intended to fuel new research and includes medical history, obstetric history, prenatal diagnosis and management, delivery outcomes, specific surgical details, family history, biological samples, and genomic data.

OBJECTIVES: Incorporate innovative privacy practices with traditional archival workflows during and as an integral component of a complex study’s active processes.

METHODS: Engage institutional compliance officers to establish a documentable solution upholding identity management for the protocol. Make recommendations to the technical/operational team for archival practices that maintain the provenance of data linked to a given patient.

RESULTS: For this specific case, we detail archival storage plans in the research protocol. We also inform patients in “lay language” that their protected health information (PHI) will be protected by honest brokering as well as stored permanently in the institutional archives.

CONCLUSION: Professional archival practices are new in the biomedical domain, and this case study is at the forefront of defining archival best practices for highly sensitive biomedical research that ensure personal information and data are preserved appropriately, all in order to advance patient outcomes.","INTRODUCTION: The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) operates a biobank following outcomes of children with congenital birth defects.

Each resource has been submitted by a member of the project team or by the broader community, and goes through a curation and review process by community reviewers prior to publication. In 2018, the Institute of Museum and Library Services awarded the DMTC a three year National Leadership Grant for its enhancement in four critical areas:

1. Expansion of the documentation model and search capabilities to include additional attributes that have been identified by users and by a metadata working group.

2. Development of integrated assessment capabilities in the DMTC that capture improved usage statistics, UI usability feedback, and learner and instructor feedback for training materials published in the DMTC.

3. Expansion and diversification of the content of the DMTC beyond the core of Earth science and research data management skill building - the early focus of DMTC collection development.

4. Targeted outreach to the academic library community to increase familiarity with and use of the DMTC, and engage the community in the continued development and growth of the DMTC.

This workshop will demonstrate the capabilities of the newly developed DMTC by:

1. Providing an overview of the DMTC and its capabilities with an emphasis on individual and small group exploration of the interface to discover skill building materials relevant to the topic areas of workshop participants.

2. Demonstrating the submission and curation process as an opportunity for workshop participants to gain an understanding of the underlying documentation model, and the submission, review and publication workflow for DMTC content.

3. Soliciting feedback from workshop participants on their experiences using the DMTC to discover materials of interest to them, and on the presented submission, review, and publication process.

4. Inviting workshop participants to join a growing community of content creators, content submitters, and reviewers.

Learning Outcomes:

1. Outcome 1 – Workshop participants will be able to use both the browse and search capabilities of the DMTC to find skill building materials relevant to their needs.

2. Outcome 2 – Workshop participants will know how to submit materials for integration into the DMTC and understand the underlying curation process to which those materials will be subjected.

3. Outcome 3 – Workshop participants will understand the various areas in which they could potentially contribute to the community activities of the DMTC: as content creators, submitters, and reviewers.

The planned outcomes of the workshop are to bring a broader familiarity with, understanding, and use of the DMTC and its content to the academic library workshop participants; to receive actionable feedback from the community that can be integrated into ongoing planning for future enhancements to the DMTC; and to invite new participants to the continued growth and diversification of content in the DMTC by serving as content creators, submitters, and reviewers.

In this presentation, two archivists and one librarian will reflect on over six years’ worth of promoting collaborative technical upskilling within the Curation team at the University of Michigan Bentley Historical Library. The presenters--who represent a number of diverse roles at the Bentley--will reflect on lessons learned from three consecutive initiatives: one provided opportunities for a small group to focus on a specific set of technical skills; another expanded the collaborative learning component of its predecessor by opening a variety of technical skills topics to the entire team; and still another provided an in-depth opportunity for a subteam to work on a single deliverable over a concentrated amount of time. The presentation will conclude with a “long view” of what went well, and what could be improved, with an emphasis on equity and inclusiveness. While the presenters come from a particular perspective, the audience should leave with relevant takeaways to bring to their own institutions, regardless of size or academic affiliation, and will be invited to share their experiences advocating for, promoting, or participating in technical upskilling throughout the presentation.","As archives and libraries expand their digital collections and services, acquiring or expanding technical skills is no longer the exclusive domain of individuals, although much of the professional literature on this topic might make it appear otherwise.

Despite their similarities, these two areas of research have not yet been compared in detail. This snapshot reports on an in-progress research study comparing data stewardship for archived qualitative data with data stewardship for big social data.

Qualitative data have been shared, archived, and reused for decades in an effort to advance scientific discoveries about human behavior, reduce burden on research subjects, and support larger-scale, longitudinal research. Librarians and data curators have developed a suite of data stewardship strategies that support responsible reuse of qualitative data—for example, data management planning, metadata schemes, and restricted access.

After being connected to an oral history expert in the medical humanities program at the School of Medicine, a protocol was developed that helped speak to the process of capturing these important stories. Librarians at the main campus academic library created a collection that began capturing photos and stories from around the state about the crisis. This collection was expanded and adapted to involve a section dedicated to oral histories. An electronic release form was developed and entrees could be collected digitally. All oral histories could be taken through a videoconferencing application, making the full process easy for busy healthcare workers that also comply with current health regulations.","This session will highlight a way of collaborating during a time of crisis and showcase how an idea from a physician became a reality.

Presenters will provide an overview of the matrix, both unpacking the distinctions between use and reuse and their various instances as well as highlighting the areas of continued debate. The ethical guidelines propose a set of core values, principles, and guidelines for the application of this assessment in a manner that accounts for the cares of GLAMR and stakeholder communities and the collections that they steward. Presenters will introduce the most current iteration of the ethical guidelines and discuss how practitioners can use it to develop more ethical, considerate assessment practices.

Hubs are shared and central technology resources used by campus partners. A technology hub can include tools like virtual reality, multimedia studios, 3D printing and virtual interactive displays.

This workshop will identify four elements for attendees to explore in developing technology integration into a hub model for their campus units and partners. Steps for this process, include:
- Knowing and identifying patron needs
- Exploring new technology
- Finding or repurposing space, and
- Allocating funds

Specific examples will be given throughout the workshop that demonstrate principles to sustain the technology interventions. Through mutual benefit and understanding, several stakeholders will assist the library in evaluating, implementing, assessing, and prioritizing changes in the hubs.

For example, dLOC’s technical team follows agile and scrum for equitably engaging stakeholders to support each according to their needs. While agile and scrum are often utilized for deeply capitalistic ends, these are also methods that avoid top-down controls and instead enable voice of those most in need and most impacted by digital library technologies.

Hashicorp's Vault platform has made it possible for us to implement a lightweight solution for secure, zero-knowledge encryption of deposited datasets, while still facilitating access requests.","Digital repositories have historically avoided accepting deposit of sensitive data, including all human subjects data which has not been adequately de-identified, on the basis that they cannot provide adequate encryption and access controls to avoid a breach in cases where disclosure risk may be very high.

The workflows will help libraries, archives, and museums navigate the following essential digitization issues:
- Ethics: Are there social or religious customs, or other circumstances—such as threats of personal or legal harm, or risks of exploitation of people, natural or cultural resources, or indigenous knowledge—that may or should impact digitization of the collections materials?
- Copyright: Are the collections materials protected by copyright and, if so, is the institution the copyright holder? If not, does a relevant copyright exception apply that permits creation and distribution of digital copies anyway?
- Contracts: Do provisions in gift or donor agreements limit the conditions under which digitization services or access can be provided?
- Privacy: Do the collections reveal information that could impinge upon the privacy rights of the subjects under federal and state laws?

Particular attention will be given to the ethics workflow’s localized practices (http://ucblib.link/34D) which promote social justice by adopting an ethics of care approach that balances whether the value to cultural communities, researchers, or the public outweighs the potential for harm or exploitation of people, resources, or knowledge.

TDM, a form of computational text analysis, is an increasingly relevant and prevalent approach to social science and humanities research. Researchers often rely on library-stewarded or licensed collections to support TDM, yet shy away from building and openly sharing diverse and representative corpora due to uncertainty around copyright and licensing restrictions. The perception of legal obstacles does not just deter research: it biases research by limiting researchers to particular topics and sources of data, leaving important questions unasked, and rendering TDM findings less broadly applicable. A growing body of research also demonstrates how race, gender, and other biases found in openly-available corpora have contributed to and exacerbated bias in the development of artificial intelligence tools.

Building LLTDM, first previewed in a 2018 DLF presentation, addresses these challenges through a framework and instructional materials for librarians and research professionals to develop copyright, licensing, privacy, and ethics literacies. Having now administered the Institute, we will leverage insights to cultivate community input and action on key calls to action surfaced by Institute: (1) moving toward TDM-friendly library licenses; (2) integrating the literacies into digital libraries to better serve computational researchers; and (3) addressing ethics at the intersection of digital library collections and computational research.","Drawing upon lessons learned from Building Legal Literacies for Text Data Mining (Building LLTDM; buildinglltdm.org), a recent NEH-funded Institute, we will overview actionable strategies for libraries to develop and implement core skills needed to navigate law, policy, ethics, and risk to better support text data mining (TDM) research.

The goal of these efforts is to arrive at a process that identifies and incorporates controlled vocabularies from marginalized communities, that respects their interests, and is not hindered by metadata formats or system technology.

One way to mitigate bias in metadata is to know about controlled vocabulary options that exist from historically marginalized communities. Within the Samvera Community, there is a working group developing guidelines and steps to determine when a controlled vocabulary is useful and how to find and evaluate a relevant controlled vocabulary for descriptive metadata creation. Another way to mitigate bias is to have options to easily incorporate controlled vocabularies for use from multiple sources. Cataloging/digital collection management applications have varying capabilities to enable term selection using different or multiple controlled vocabularies. Additionally, Linked Data vocabularies can connect terms between larger, less representative vocabularies (like Library of Congress Subject Headings) and terms from a community’s vocabulary to aid and instruct end users conducting research online. Yet another way to disrupt metadata bias is to support communities who are providing controlled vocabularies. Working through steps to discover and use controlled vocabulary options from marginalized communities helps to center those communities’ concerns by advocating to use terminology from those communities in descriptive practice and encouraging software improvements to better support varied controlled vocabulary use.","Mitigating bias in metadata is not a finite task but this talk shares experiences in identifying ways to disrupt metadata bias.

","Too often when documenting movement, the community within which dances are created is ignored or overlooked. By combining insights from knowledgeable members of the communities themselves with new technological tools we can improve the interdisciplinary study of dance and other forms of movement through structured data and well-curated digital resources.","The DanceDance Annotation project’s high level goal is to build a trusted video annotation platform for community practitioners, students, and scholars to produce and share new knowledge about the study of human movement. The platform will host videos of dances in an online space where members of origin communities can lead engagements with these materials, annotate videos, and assist in the development of a searchable database. Annotation will be supported by three vocabularies including Choreometrics codes, Laban Movement Analysis elements, and vocabularies supplied by the communities of origin. In addition to the annotated movement videos, the database will include contextual material such as still photos, oral history files, and additional documents supplied by the origin communities and other archives. Disseminating these contextualized analyses will make information about cultural traditions, as reflected in dance, accessible to a community of origin as well as researchers and scholars. Our platform will allow researchers to investigate questions that were previously difficult to study, such as: How can scholars and practitioners share and communicate findings on the evolution of movement practices in a given location? How can we compare specific dance practices in one or more cultures to better understand dance's relationship to identity building, social production, community bonding and social structure including factors of gender, race, ethnicity, and age? How can we return ownership of the dances to communities of origin? And finally, how could digital media technology allow us to see the movement more clearly?

",We will demonstrate a tool developed at Kansas State University and the University of Idaho to improve on the problems of georeferencing academic literature through NLP and automation. We will discuss new ways of using spatial data layers to infer additional metadata to enhance the searching/browsing process for users.,"Searching scientific literature typically involves using keywords or controlled vocabularies, ignoring the geographic location of where the research was done. When geographic location is present, it is usually in the form of a laboriously assigned controlled vocabulary. Many “georeferenced bibliographies” have tried to improve on this by geolocating the study area described in the article, but are often unsustainable, requiring extensive labor. Our presentation will highlight a project at K-State and the University of Idaho to improve on these problems. We will demonstrate a prototype for automating georeferencing of documents and providing a search/browse interface that uses the location to infer additional metadata through the use of varying spatial data layers. We will use audience contributions to explore the logic of how geographic locations can be used to create better recall and precision in searching.

Good platforms for literature discovery cost time, labor, and expertise that often is only available through expensive discovery tools or academic literature databases. This project is entirely open-source and aims to make its bibliographic catalog of georeferenced literature openly available without restriction, through an API as well as custom-built widgets for some existing systems used in libraries. Our belief is that innovations in allowing a user to find papers based on their inferred context - e.g., a search for papers on domestic violence where one can limit to locations based on a map of population density or income levels - should be available to all users and libraries. Our project aims to do so.","Searching scientific literature typically involves using keywords or controlled vocabularies, ignoring the geographic location of where the research was done.

Constants may also need care, however. This presentation will consider ways that people and organizations can build radical empathy within and across a virtual community.","In ArchivesSpace we take great pride in having built a strong virtual community over the years. Like much of the U.S., in March 2020 nearly everyone in our community confronted a new reality that kept them from their physical spaces, disrupted their regular routines and cut them off from their usual in-person professional and personal interactions. In math or physics a constant remains the same in all circumstances and all conditions. For many in our community, ArchivesSpace has become their constant in this time, and we have leapt into action and responded to the call -- developing new programs, shoring up well-established ones, being a steady presence as people sought things that would get them through the workday. Thousands of our users have attended events, requested help or just been in touch since the coronavirus crisis began.

But what happens when ""the constant"" is confronting a version of that same new reality? In a field of helpers, how can we signal for empathy from others and allow ourselves to need help? This presentation will discuss some ways that people and organizations can provide the support needed by those they serve without sacrificing themselves.

At Penn, we have scaled up a project researching copyrights of 20th century serials to involve more than two dozen workers in all parts of the library system. Staff who had previously worked mostly offline and those whose work was impacted by closures were invited to participate. We are investigating thousands of serials held by Penn that may lack copyright renewals or notices. We are searching databases and the Web for renewal information, other evidence related to copyright, and existing free digital scans, and putting this information in machine-readable linked data records tied into Wikidata. Making this information available will help make a rich deep backfile of serial issues throughout the 20th century readable and reusable by researchers not just at our library, but well beyond.

As expectations of interactivity and context-aware design increase, it’s vital that libraries evolve to fit these needs and expectations. This presentation will feature a panel from the Atlanta University Center Robert W. Woodruff Library, which is the library for a consortium of four Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Each panelist will discuss how Geographic Information Systems are being used in an academic library setting, such as geo-referencing of historical maps in archives, creating a geo-referenced directory of Georgia's natural, cultural and historical organizations (NCHs) for disaster preparedness, and using StoryMaps and custom Google Maps in creative ways for assignments in digital humanities.

Session attendees will learn how GIS is being used in archives through using ArcGIS, the benefits and challenges of this kind of engagement, and the importance of making underrepresented resources available to users. Attendees will see how a directory of Georgia’s NCHs was created, and how to replicate the project to preserve their own region's rich natural, cultural, and historical resources using free online tools. Last, session attendees will learn about teaching GIS topics through the use of StoryMaps and custom Google Maps. The panelists will also discuss how teaching GIS can be informed by ACRL’s Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education.

This panel will focus on providing examples, demonstrations, and tools that others can use when implementing GIS at their institution. Attendees will be provided with applications, example assignments, and approaches to teaching with GIS.
