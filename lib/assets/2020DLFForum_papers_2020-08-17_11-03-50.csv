Put another way, the Reader consumes just about any number of files in any just about any format, and it outputs plain text files, delimited files, a relational database, and a set of HTML reports all for the purposes of systematic reading. The first half of this workshop will be on the use of the Distant Reader. Attendees will learn how to submit content to the Reader, and then how to interact with the HTML reports. Thus, attendees will be able to ""read"" dozens of websites, hundreds of books, thousands of journal articles, or just about anything on their computer. The second half of the workshop will be on hacking the Reader's structured data. Given the plain text files, tab-delimited files, and relational database the Reader also outputs, attendees will learn how to do various visualizations against the data, subset the data with SQL, index the data with Solr, normalize the data with OpenRefine, use machine learning against the data, etc., all for the purposes of more in-depth analysis. It is our sincere hope attendees -- given some instruction -- will exploit the structured data and create interesting hacks of their own.

Participants will only need a laptop computer, an Internet connection, and a Web browser in order to get the most out of this workshop. Advanced topics, which are definitely a small percentage of the workshop, require working from the command-line.

The National Archives and Records Administration guestimates that 30 million records are available for that time period. The records are double and tri-folded, and there is no inventory of the records held. Large amounts of time are required to closely examine these records because of their current condition. Serious researcher requires spending time in the D.C. metro area to examine these records, but they are also spread out among 33 regional facilities, out of the reach of many.

In 2002, the project was launched seeking to shift the paradigm of presidential projects which digitize only signature documents of that particular president, without the context to better understand those records.

Every document within the scope of the project i.e. November 1860 after the election, to April 15, 1865, pushing out to cover the assassination, the capture of the conspirators, the trial of Henry Wirz and Andersonville, the capture of Jefferson Davis, and his imprisonment at Ft. Monroe, and closing the project with the trial of John Surratt, in 1867.

Discussion of organizing a project, storage requirements, digital security, content management system, digitization standards, and migration will be discussed.

Those thinking about digitizing, who are digitizing, and who have successes and failures, all are welcome. This session will be an educational opportunity for all.

Existing and planned initiatives in research data curation and mass audio/visual digitization may rapidly increase the scale of content available for preservation management by upwards of an order of magnitude. However, one significant impediment to more widespread utilization of the program’s services and repository is the financial implications of the program’s partial-cost recovery business model, under which individual Library units are charged annually for used storage capacity. This financial impact is exacerbated by the fact that all content managed in the repository currently is subject to the same high-level policy of four independent replicas, which is many cases is cost-prohibitive and not necessarily needed to meet legitimate curatorial goals. Thus, the Library is moving towards a more flexible storage architecture under which the disposition of a given resource to some number of replicated storage targets is adaptively controlled by that resource’s formal characteristics and relevant curatorial policy, assessment, and intention.

When a digital collection used to be created, it was enough that the collection itself was available. Over the past 3 years, we have captured the who, what, when, where, and how relating to each and every digital collection. In many cases for the older digital collections, we had misplaced or never had a lot of needed information. I’ll share how we dealt with this issue and how we changed our workflow for creating new digital collections to prevent this issue in the future.

We made decisions about the digital environment and its structure based on who, internal and external, needed to access the documentation and when during the digital collection lifecycle. I’ll share how we considered user access and controls during implementation.

This documentation work is part of the assessment of digital collections on which we presented two years ago to the DLF community. We hope to share our workflow and approach in hopes that we can collaborate with others as they consider their long-term organizational needs around documentation for any digital project.","Institutional knowledge needs to be documented in a shared space, not kept in an individual’s head or location only accessible to a single person.

Since its launch, PA Digital has expanded significantly. More than 80 institutions have contributed rich collections to PA Digital, allowing us to curate primary source sets for educators on topics such as the labor movement in the steel industry, students protest, Quakers and the abolitionist movement, and women’s suffrage. We began the project harvesting mostly from CONTENTdm, but as interest and participation grew, we adapted to harvest from systems such as Bepress, Islandora, Omeka, Samvera, and VUDL. With each new system, modifications to our software and extensive troubleshooting were required. Further, Metadata Specialists had no flexibility to transform or validate metadata, so contributors had to make adjustments locally. It became increasingly cumbersome to efficiently make Pennsylvania’s unique collections available through the DPLA. It was clear we needed a new, more sustainable system.

PA Digital’s Metadata Specialists partnered with developer staff to create personas and user stories, draft functional requirements, and explore new systems to aggregate, process, and review metadata at scale. The team looked beyond library software systems and decided on Airflow, an open-source workflow management platform. PA Digital’s implementation of Airflow calls XSLT and Schematron scripts from GitHub, stores data in AWS, indexes in SolrCloud, and pushes data onto OAI-PMH servers and into a Blacklight interface (funnelcake.padigital.org).

113,Virtual 2020 DLF Forum,45-minute Panel,"Henry, Charles","CLIR, United States of America",,DLF at 25: Maturing Digital Libraries. The Continuity of Essential Resources,,"infrastructure, scholarship, sustainability, crisis",I/we agree to share this submission under a CC-BY 4.0 license.,I/we agree to share this submission under a CC-BY 4.0 license.,,,,,The lack of sufficient infrastructure and continuity of support for digital scholarship and its products has reached a point of crisis.,The lack of sufficient infrastructure and continuity of support for digital scholarship and its products has reached a point of crisis.,"

One definition of maturity is the ability to respond to the environment and know when and how to act according to current circumstances and broader societal needs. The Digital Library Federation has always sought to invent and realize the means for universal, sustained, transformative access to the content of libraries, archives, and other cultural heritage institutions as a shared effort across institutions and active engagement across the ever-growing, ever-developing profession.

The digital library concept 25 years ago-- a vision of seamless access to vast quantities of content--was at first a technical undertaking, that then proved to be much more, capable of transmuting organizations, practitioners, research, teaching and society. This 25th anniversary is an inflection point, and an urgent one.

Concurrent with DLF’s 25th Anniversary, the National Endowment for the Humanities, The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and the American Council of Learned Societies have begun a national conversation that will purposefully address the endangered persistence of essential digital projects integral to the humanities and social sciences. The lack of sufficient infrastructure and continuity of support for digital scholarship and its products has reached a point of crisis.

The current problem has several recognizable sources. Over the past quarter century, the environment of higher education in which most digital libraries have been developed has been competitive, with funding focused on individual, distinct projects, and a propensity at colleges and universities not to incorporate digital library costs into operational budgets once external funding has ceased. These circumstances have often produced digital libraries as incremental projects, as a series of digitization and technical efforts additive to the pre-digital library world. Some of the most prominent digital libraries, considered indispensable by scholarly disciplines, remain fragile with an uncertain future.

The 25th anniversary is thus a moment to reflect upon the enormous accomplishments of the previous decades and to consider where we have potentially the most to gain from re-visioning, from re-prioritizing, from re-allocating; from stronger, broader, and new modes of collaboration; from new or different investments and developments. It is a moment to consider where the fruits of our work are endangered by unsolved problems or unresolved policies. It is a moment to imagine an expanded, healthy, re-imagined, and attainable digital library future, and to consider the strategic directions to achieve it.

Two plenary panel presentations are proposed. In the first, a group of distinguished participants and leaders involved with DLF and digital library evolution over the past decades will discuss key ideas and challenges they have experienced to help frame the current crisis of sustainability. The proposed speakers include Donald Waters, Wendy Lougee, Brett Bobley, and Charles Henry. Moderator: Carol Mandel

A second panel presentation will bring together current leaders and thinkers who are positioning the mature, integrated generation of digital library implementation. They will help initiate an agenda that can respond to the crisis of sustainability. Speakers will include Jennifer Garcon, Tyler Walters, Kate Zwaard, and William Kilbride. Moderator: Geneva Henry

In the first, a group of distinguished participants and leaders involved with DLF and digital library evolution over the past decades will discuss key ideas and challenges they have experienced to help frame the current crisis of sustainability. The proposed speakers include Donald Waters, Wendy Lougee, Brett Bobley, and Charles Henry. Moderator: Carol Mandel
A second panel presentation will bring together current leaders and thinkers who are positioning the mature, integrated generation of digital library implementation. They will help initiate an agenda that can respond to the crisis of sustainability. Speakers will include Jennifer Garcon, Tyler Walters, Kate Zwaard, and William Kilbride.

The project also addresses challenges in archival partnerships in the public humanities.","This paper argues that a critical engagement with endangered archives may provide not only a lasting form of community enrichment, but more powerfully, a liberatory and anticolonialist enterprise. However, the chapter also shows the limits of these high-minded goals by following to its present conclusion the partnership that this chapter outlines. By incorporating the voices of high school teachers, an on-site AmeriCorps VISTA partner, and discussion of ways in which the extensive groundwork in this project was undercut by a change in leadership at the partner institution, this chapter also considers the value of seeing specific failures within a larger context of the positive impacts a project can sustain, and the power of persevering in the face of changing human relations. Following a theorization of how local archives work across their digital and physical forms to expand the concept of place-based learning, this chapter describes how Cohen, along with a team of undergraduate researchers and an AmeriCorps VISTA partner, implemented a project that relied on a well-developed relationship with the community partners, both volunteers and staff, at Pine Mountain Settlement School. The project aims to embrace a deeply marginalized community by supporting them to tell their own stories using historical documents made visible from a neglected past inherited from their very own communities.

Due to copyright restrictions on most twentieth and twenty-first century literature, innovative approaches are increasingly necessary for advancing the collections as data movement and the scholarly fields of cultural analytics and digital scholarship.

Temple Libraries have been digitizing underrepresented works of post-WWII “New Wave” science fiction, developing a cross-departmental workflow to ingest the scans and OCR’d text into HathiTrust’s repository for preservation and curation. This process required evaluating gaps in HathiTrust’s holdings and developing a local, adaptable model of digitization, ingestion, and exhibition. The project is expanding to include collaborations with Texas A&M Libraries’ and Kansas University Libraries’ special collections in science fiction, with plans to diversify the institutions involved in the grassroots digitization effort, including non-member libraries of HathiTrust and international partners.

The HathiTrust Digital Library is a collaborative, large-scale repository of texts accumulated through the mass digitization of research library collections, and as such, reflects the traditional collecting practices of those institutions. Like many organizations, HathiTrust is reviewing its systems, operations and practices to rectify ongoing inequalities addressed by social justice movements like Black Lives Matter. As we move towards greater inclusion of underrepresented voices, materials, and genres in our digital collection through more intentional acquisition, we are exploring new, coordinated digitization and ingestion workflows that balance scale and sustainability with equity and value.","This presentation explores a collaborative digitization project between Temple University Libraries and other Special Collections with holdings in mass-market science fiction, aimed at leveraging HathiTrust Digital Library’s infrastructure for data preservation and curation.

In 2017, 133 people who took the survey, roughly 46% either disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement “The way our digital preservation function is currently organized (staffing levels, expertise, where they are placed within the larger organization) works well.” This represents a significant shift from the 2012 results, in which only 34% of participants responded similarly.

This panel will center around a study we conducted to understand what is causing or may be contributing to the high and rising levels of dissatisfaction that practitioners reported. We interviewed 21 digital stewards and asked them to describe the organizational context in which they work; to reflect on what aspects of their organizations’ approach to digital preservation are working well and which are not; and to evaluate necessary areas of improvement. We identified experiences that were common among participants using a qualitative research methodology based on phenomenology. These conversations revealed that practitioners largely consider digital stewardship values and goals to be misunderstood at an organizational level, and demonstrated that the absence of a long-term vision for digital stewardship disempowers practitioners. The goal of this study was to better understand the increasing dissatisfaction expressed by respondents to the NDSA Staffing Surveys about how their work is organized, and accordingly, to identify specific areas and benchmarks for improvement in digital preservation program design.

This panel will report the results of our work and then ask audience members to engage in a guided discussion. We will generate questions that are designed to spark discussion and debate amongst the panelists and audience members alike. This will allow for two key outcomes: 1) the panelists can discuss the reflections based on their study, and 2) the audience members will be able to share their insight and interpretations, which will, in turn, increase the diversity of perspectives considered in shaping the project’s conclusions and outcomes.

The themes discussed in this panel will reveal key signifiers of how practitioners perceive success or failure in digital preservation programs that transcend variations in institutional type or funding model. They will inform efforts to improve the overall functionality of digital preservation programs and will have practical implications for practitioners themselves, the middle managers who often directly oversee their work, and the senior-level administrators charged with leading their organizations. We hope that audience members will take away from this panel a vision for a successful model of digital preservation practice -- one that sustains its workforce as well as its mission.

The goal of these efforts is to arrive at a process that identifies and incorporates controlled vocabularies from marginalized communities, that represents their interests, and is not hindered by metadata formats or system technology.

One way to mitigate bias in metadata is to know about controlled vocabulary options that exist from historically marginalized communities. Within the Samvera Community, there is a working group developing guidelines and steps to determine when a controlled vocabulary is useful and how to find and evaluate a relevant controlled vocabulary for descriptive metadata creation. Another way to mitigate bias is to have options to easily incorporate vocabularies for use in creating descriptive metadata or offering vocabularies for online researchers to use for discovery and access. Cataloging/digital collection management applications have varying capabilities to enable term selection using controlled vocabularies and open source options exist with some level of flexibility. Additionally, Linked Data vocabularies can be used to connect terms between larger, less representative vocabularies (like Library of Congress Subject Headings) and terms from a community’s vocabulary to aid and instruct end users conducting research online. Yet another way is to engage with communities who are providing controlled vocabularies. Working through steps to discover and use alternative controlled vocabulary options from marginalized communities necessarily involves engaging and supporting those communities, helping to centralize the community’s concerns by advocating to use their vocabulary.

With Miriam Posner’s call to “come up with better ways of investing in people’s long-term potential as scholars” in mind, Leigh Bonds developed a professional development program to provide disciplinary librarians opportunities to attend immersive workshops in digital scholarship. Those participating in the program could choose from workshops that provide a general overview of the digital scholarship methods and tools; a subject-specific overview of methods and tools; or intensive training on a specific method, tool, or topic. The executive team approved a pilot program (2019-20) to focus on digital humanities, funding eight librarians in the arts and humanities liaison cohorts, special collections, and area studies. During the pilot year, the minimum requirements for participants included developing at least one annual goal related to digital scholarship, joining the campus DH Slack channel, and participating in the fall University Libraries’ Digital Scholarship Forum.

Minimally, Bonds anticipated these workshops would enable librarians to identify either research projects or course assignments that could be enhanced by using a digital method/tool. At most, she thought they would prepare her colleagues to collaborate with researchers on projects, collaborate with faculty and graduate students to integrate digital scholarship instruction and projects into courses, and/or develop their own digital projects. With six participating in the pilot, the program proved transformational: each participant benefitted from having intensive workshop experiences to not only delve deeply into the method(s)/tool(s), but also develop close connections to broader networks of colleagues and practitioners. Participants attended DHSI, UPenn's DREAMLab, HILT, Princeton’s Slavic DH Summer Workshop, ARL's Digital Scholarship Institute, and the DLF Forum’s pre-conference workshops. Each successfully integrated their learning into their librarianship, and began generating new ideas around collections and discussing those ideas across the organization. On their own initiative, the first cohort formed a bi-weekly working group to support one another as they integrated DH methods into their librarianship and scholarship. Based on these successful outcomes, the Libraries’ management committee approved a two-year extension of the program, expanding it to ten participants that include librarians from the social sciences and sciences.

This panel will provide an overview of the program and its outcomes, providing conference attendees with a potential model for building capacity for DS support at their own institutions. Bonds will outline details about the program—including participant requirements and costs—and discuss the ripple effect the program has had across the organization. Three participants will then share the experiences of those from their respective areas and discuss the program’s impact on their librarianship and scholarship: Courtney Hunt will represent participants from the arts and humanities liaison cohort; Jen Schnabel, special collections; and Ann Marie Davis, area studies.

These institutions were allies in or at least instruments of the political and legal dominance of one culture over others. Alternative or mitigative models to this colonization have emerged in response: decolonizing, postcolonial, postcustodial, and slow archives. This presentation discusses an alternative model based on the Digital Library of the Caribbean (dLOC), which incorporates tenants of shared governance, mutual aid, generous thinking, community building, polycentrism, collaborative pluralism, and mutual dependency. Importantly, we discuss dLOC’s ways of working: utilizing concepts and methods from agile/scrum technical development and managerial theories based on fairness, fostering self-determination and supporting our communities.

dLOC’s alternative model is baked-in and extends through all aspects, including organizational design and technical development. For example, dLOC’s technical team follows agile and scrum for equitably engaging stakeholders to support each according to their needs. While agile and scrum are often utilized for deeply capitalistic ends, these are also methods that avoid top-down controls and instead enable voice of those most in need and most impacted by digital library technologies. These range from developers to stakeholders at partner institutions. Additionally, dLOC’s alternative model reflects concepts from progressive management theory that have developed over time in the literature but are not commonly applied to scholarship on digital libraries. These broad concepts include agency, procedural justice, and organizational support, and translate to meaningful work and community supports for other stakeholders and institutions.

We’d like to gather like-minded colleagues to discuss their work and interest in similar approaches and identify points of intersection to determine interest in working toward a common approach.

We will invite attendees to briefly describe their work and interests via a short survey to be distributed to attendees at the beginning of the unconference. The unconference session will include a brief introduction to the topic and feature small group and large group discussions on the intersection of work and interest in exploring opportunities to work together. Session attendees will be asked to group up based on topics that emerge in the survey results or in the initial session discussion, and then report back during the final group discussion.

We expect the following themes might emerge:
- Cloud-native approaches versus vendor neutrality
- Infrastructure component choices
- Preservation in a black box
- Defining services and service compositions and documented interfaces to support multiple implementations

The Cloud-Native Digital Libraries unconference aligns with the conference theme Technologies, infrastructure, and/or vendor relations in that the goal of this unconference is to explore new approaches to digital libraries platforms. All products, notes, diagrams, and presentations will be made available following the session. The unconference conveners will also provide a summary of the event and anonymous responses.

This presentation will outline the balance of cost-effectiveness and creating a trustworthy platform while relying on the cloud.","Virginia Tech University Libraries (VTUL) began work on our Digital Libraries Platform to address difficulty building digital preservation solutions with software not designed for that purpose; to reduce our maintenance obligations and expense of on-premises servers; and to provide scalable, performant systems that were beyond our ability or budget to provide internally. To address this, VTUL is developing a cloud-based serverless microservice application to support digital asset management, preservation, and access. In light of the expected effects of Covid-19 on our budget, we value that cloud providers allow us to choose services and how those services are delivered based on cost and performance. We are therefore able to differentiate between services that require performance and those that can run asynchronously at a lower cost.

We’ve found that implementing this microservice architecture, as opposed to monolithic architectures, allows us to develop, version, and call services independently based on the Levels of Digital Preservation appropriate for specific materials. Preservation microservices include on-ingest and scheduled fixity, format characterization, and other functionality that may be called independently and are instantiated only when needed.

In this presentation we will focus on a serverless cloud-native approach to fixity creation and validation as well as the financial and transparency implications of this approach. While cloud-vendors advertise 99.9999% data durability, we have chosen to implement our own services to verify data in blackbox vendor systems.

The three panelists will give brief presentations of their work. Margo Padilla will discuss establishing a born-digital program as the first digital archivist at N-YHS, in a temporary, grant-funded position. Margo’s project responsibilities include developing a scaled-down approach to born-digital stewardship that can be easily implemented and grow in complexity as she trains permanent staff in full lifecycle management of born-digital materials. Siobhan Hagan will discuss scaling digital preservation best practices for the public across the US through the Memory Lab Network. She will detail the work conducted in “training the trainers” of public librarians across the country, providing access to increasingly virtual resources, and creating realistic solutions for personal digital archiving issues. Maggie Schreiner will discuss creating a low-cost and iterative born-digital records program at Brooklyn Historical Society: building a low-cost digital forensics workstation, creating a retrospective disk imaging project to capture legacy collections materials, and developing appraisal and access procedures for born-digital collections. Following these presentations, we will facilitate a group conversation about the most common themes.

After a recent significant redesign of the University of Tennessee’s Digital Collections website, a usability study to assess users’ experiences with the new features was carried out using Loop11. Participants were recruited from English 102 classes that were using the site to complete a primary source assignment. In pursuing real information needs, the participants searched for topics as diverse as moonshine and body image. Their experiences were captured using screen recordings, heat maps, and written feedback. This data was used to analyze the effectiveness of new website features, including a Learn More page, collection groups, and a way to limit searches by resource type. While many of the participants were able to use these features successfully, the study identified ways to improve the site for more efficient search and navigation. In particular, the data indicated that participants had difficulty narrowing the records to the most relevant results. In addition, the placement of the “Learn More” section was not intuitive for most users. An unintended outcome of the study was the increased integration of Digital Collections resources into standard library instruction sessions as a result of collaboration with liaisons while preparing the study and recruiting participants.

In order to encourage participation, the presenters will ask for audience feedback. Topics will include strategies for transitioning in-person studies to online protocols in the wake of COVID-19 and composing questions that elicit useful responses.","Evaluation and assessment are crucial aspects of managing any search interface.

In these workshops, aside from learning new skills and preparing stories for varied audiences, the students also benefit from making connections with other graduate students and developing their creations in a workshop environment. Storytelling Fellows is very work driven and community based.

In response to a growing interest in TEI, or text encoding, on our campuses, we took an online professional development workshop on how to encode and create digital editions of texts with the TEI standards. The workshop that we attended was good--and it met its own goals--but after having taken it, we couldn’t help but to wonder what a TEI workshop would look like in the Storytelling Fellows design that we’ve developed and come to trust. In particular, we wanted to design a workshop that would be much more project-based, learner driven, and conducive to people making connections, not just with teachers, but also with cohort members.

In a presentation, we would give some background about the Storytelling Fellows model before laying out how we used that framework to design a fun, interactive TEI workshop. We would also be able to relate how our design worked and what revisions we look to do upon further iteration.

Fedora is used in a wide variety of institutions including libraries, museums, archives, and government organizations. For the past several years the Fedora community has prioritized alignment with linked data best practices and modern web standards. We are now shifting our attention back to Fedora's digital preservation roots with a focus on durability and the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL). This tutorial will provide an introduction to the latest version of Fedora with a focus on digital preservation functionality and workflows. Both new and existing Fedora users will be interested in learning about and experiencing Fedora features first-hand.

Attendees will be given access to individual online sandbox instances of Fedora. These sandboxes will be used to participate in hands-on exercises that will give attendees a chance to experience Fedora by following step-by-step instructions. The workshop will include three modules, each of which can be delivered in 1 hour or less:

Introduction and Feature Tour

This module will feature an introduction to Fedora generally, with a focus on the latest version, followed by an overview of the core and extended Fedora features. It will also include a primer on data modeling in Fedora.

Digital Preservation Workflows

Fedora has a number of features that support digital preservation, including fixity checking, versioning, and backup/restore. Fedora also provides a robust REST-API that can be used to integrate with other applications and services in a broader digital preservation workflow. This module will demonstrate both Fedora’s internal digital preservation features and API-driven integrations.

Fedora 6 and the Oxford Common File Layout

Fedora 6, the next major version of Fedora, will focus on digital preservation by aligning with the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL). The OFCL is an application-independent approach to the storage of digital objects in a structured, transparent, and predictable manner. It is designed to promote long-term access and management of digital objects within digital repositories. This module will provide an overview of the Fedora 6 design, including a brief introduction to the OCFL and how it is being implemented, along with a summary of development progress to date and the anticipated timeline for the 6.0 release.

Workshop attendees will:

1. Become familiar with core and extended Fedora features and functionality

2. Learn how to create and manage content in Fedora in accordance with digital preservation best practices

3. Understand the benefits of the OCFL and how it will be implemented in Fedora 6

This workshop is intended to be an introduction to Fedora - no prior experience with the platform is required. Repository managers and librarians will get the most out of this tutorial, though developers new to Fedora would likely also be interested.

Participants will need laptops in order to access the online sandbox and participate in hands on exercises. The room should be equipped with powerstrips for the laptops, and everyone will need wireless internet access.","Fedora is a flexible, extensible, open source repository platform for managing, preserving, and providing access to digital content.

Recent events such as the global pandemic have amplified the importance of access and discovery to such collections. As people including students, researchers, and life long learners work from their homes, access to digitized materials has become an even more a part of people’s daily lives. With funding from a Mellon-funded initiative called “Collections As Data” (https://collectionsasdata.github.io/part2whole/cohortone/), a team including the workshop leaders are developing methods for image analysis among archival collections. In the “Images as Data through Distant Viewing” hands-on workshop, we will explore methods for transforming digital images into data for search and discovery.

The workshop will begin with an introduction to the concept of distant viewing as a theoretical and methodological frame for applying computer vision. Following a brief introduction to the programming language R, the workshop will focus on how to extract features in images such as art, film, and photography. Feature extraction will include color, image similarity, and objects. Next, we will turn to how the metadata produced using these processes can inform new forms of collections discovery, such as user-driven recommender systems. Participants will also have the opportunity to apply and adjust the code using Rmarkdown notebooks, which can then be re-used for their own data in the future.

Continuing an institutional history of creating collections as data, a group of Michigan State University librarians, digital humanists, and faculty formed a working group in 2018 to compile and analyze comic book data. From MSUL’s Comics Collection, which holds more than 300,000 print comic book titles, we extracted a subset of about 50,000 records of comics published in North America. We normalized and standardized publication dates, publisher names and their locations to map the evolution of comics publishing over time. We reconciled each comic’s publisher and author data against Wikidata. Future work to add the many smaller comics publishers and creators present in MSUL’s collection to Wikidata will help increase their visibility and expand our understanding of comics as a medium.

As we worked on the project, we left room for our final outcomes to serve all members of the team based on our needs, interests, and skills. We made the dataset openly available through a GitLab repository, where we will share data visualizations that present the collection in new ways so that scholars and members of the public can explore and interrogate this unique collection.

We see this presentation as an opportunity to share the results of our work, from the perspectives of comic book history, library and information science, and digital humanities project development and to start a conversation about developing and adapting a project across disciplinary boundaries.","This presentation reports on an ongoing collaborative project that examines library catalog data to explore geographies of publishing and library collecting policies in North American comics.

This practice is aimed at mitigating the risks faced by the digital materials being preserved.

However, there has been little quantitative work done to allow institutions to make informed decisions about which risks actually pose the biggest threat to their collections. With limited resources we have to choose which mitigations to apply. Would an institution’s overall digital preservation risk be lowered most by concentrating on staff training, or by aiming to reach NDSA Level 2 in Storage, or would improving Integrity first be more effective?

DiAGRAM’s foundation is a Bayesian Network - a statistical model that estimates the probability of outcomes by considering conditional events and changes over time (e.g. the lifespan of our archival storage depends on a changing mix of storage media types). Bayesian networks have been used as a foundation for decision support tools in a variety of contexts.

We will illustrate how our online tool, DiAGRAM, can:

Improve users' understanding of the complex digital archiving risk landscape and of the interplay between risk factors.

Empower archivists to compare and prioritize very different types of threats to the digital archive: from software obsolescence to natural disaster.

Aid in quantifying the impact of risk events and risk management strategies on archival outcomes to support decision making, communication with stakeholders and developing business cases for targeted action.

However, funding from a 2019 IMLS grant expanded opportunities to teach and implement the platform more broadly through partnerships across the country, and feedback from partners has led to alterations that make CollectionBuilder more broadly adaptable.

Librarians at the State Library of North Carolina initiated the development of a “multi-collection” option for CollectionBuilder’s CONTENTdm skin, which allows creators to use objects from multiple digital collections when curating a digital exhibit. At the New College of Florida (NCF), the CollectionBuilder skin was modified to interact with SobekCM Repository’s API and build explorative interfaces on top of existing collections. Additionally, the tool’s use in pedagogical settings at NCF has demonstrated CollectionBuilder’s value in teaching data management and web development concepts alongside digital collection practices.

The build-up of ‘micro-abrasions’ – a slow sanding of the glass – was impacting digitization quality, throughput, queues, and budget lines. Staff theorized that clay-coated paper could be to blame.

These clay-coated papers are being digitized at a higher rate across the field due to increased permissions agreements for in-copyright materials, the now moving public domain wall in the US, and Controlled Digital Lending practices.

Using glass with anti-reflective coatings will require increased monitoring for micro-abrasions, grouping of like-sized materials to extend platen life, and alterations in selection and prioritization practices. Using non-coated glass will require lighting and camera adjustments to avoid reflections, which have implications for imaging.

These clay-coated papers are being digitized at a higher rate across the field due to increased permissions agreements for in-copyright materials, the now moving public domain wall in the US, and Controlled Digital Lending practices.
Using glass with anti-reflective coatings will require increased monitoring for micro-abrasions, grouping of like-sized materials to extend platen life, and alterations in selection and prioritization practices. Using non-coated glass will require lighting and camera adjustments to avoid reflections, which have implications for imaging. Digitization teams may need to compensate in the future by equipping their labs with multiple glass types.",,,"Chapman, Jacqueline",Smithsonian Libraries,United States of America,North_America, ,chapmanje@si.edu,jacqueline.emily.chapman@gmail.com,"chapmanje@si.edu, euphratd@si.edu, wagnerkc@si.edu","Chapman, Jacqueline;

","This session focuses on successful reorganization to meet changing campus needs, align with a new strategic plan, and lead the evolution of a new digital scholarship support model. We describe the ways in which we brought along administrative and technical folks unused to working collaboratively on messy faculty projects.","The Digital Humanities Initiative (DHi) began as a pioneering model for how to support digital humanities research at a small liberal arts college. DHi drew heavily on staff support from the Metadata & Digital Strategies (MaDS) and Network Services within Hamilton College Library and Information Technology Services (LITS). It focused on archive based research by faculty and students. After ten years of success, opportunities for change presented themselves through staff turnover, a new senior cabinet at Hamilton College, and a new strategic plan focused on developing digital skills in faculty and students. LITS seized this opportunity to evolve its support for digital scholarship into a model that would provide broader assistance for a wider range of projects and also connect departments more directly within LITS.

Discovering this new model of support involved challenging those in LITS to think about connections across the roles of staff members within the organization. This required getting buy-in from key members of LITS, reorganizing staff on a small scale and disrupting some established ways of thinking and doing things, including bringing together academic and administrative experts to work collaboratively on risky faculty projects. After evaluating potential collaborative support models, Academic Digital Initiatives was born. It includes key members of the Business Intelligence & Web Services, Infrastructure, MaDS and Research & Instructional Design units who serve as project managers, shepherding faculty and administrative projects through a process that includes agile frameworks, project sprints, and documentation of lessons learned. Leading these changes required clear communication for stakeholders across multiple levels.

Congregational Library & Archives, in partnership with the Phillips Library, UCC

Connecticut Conference, and New England Historic Genealogical Society, has

successfully digitized over 20,000 pages of Early-American Congregational records.

These records have been utilized by many different groups, such as by genealogists

for family history services and society membership applications, and by academic

researches to extrapolate historic climate data and track the impact of infectious

diseases. Some of these uses were expected, but many were completely

unexpected, and drastically changed how the CLA thought about these records and

how they might be used.

However, limitations regarding the display and acquisition of metadata related to

these digitized materials has hampered both access and visibility for researchers

and general users, as well as efforts to showcase under-represented narratives.

Consequently, the CLA has initiated an overhaul of how digital collections are

accessed, searched, and displayed. In collaboration with researchers and AVP (a

DAMS consultant), the CLA developed functional requirements for how these digital

records will be handled and displayed.

We therefore propose a paper presentation which will examine how our digitized

records have been used, how we believe they can be better used, and the

methodologies we developed to create a vision of our digital future. We believe that

our example - a small library with a small staff thinking large about its digital future
- will benefit and provide a roadmap for similarly sized institutions.","The New England’s Hidden Histories (NEHH) project, administered by the

In the midst of rapidly changing user needs, libraries also compete with increasingly personal experiences on popular websites that often enable more personalized online experiences than those offered by libraries.

In this program, panelists will discuss new ways librarians can connect with people through the non-library websites they regularly consult for information. They will demonstrate the success that partnerships with some of the largest consumer and education sites have delivered in increasing the visibility of libraries and will show how libraries can benefit from these programs.

Panelists representing a cross-section of library types and sizes and commercial organizations will also discuss opportunities for partnerships that increase the visibility of unique special collections in digital, electronic, and physical formats.

During this interactive program, participants will share their own approaches for gaining the attention of hard-to-reach information seekers and will have the opportunity to brainstorm additional tactics that will reinforce their value in the eyes of their users. Participants will leave the program with recommendations for new tactics to try when they return to their libraries.

This initiative, established in conjunction with a university-wide open access initiative, will result in the first significant open access collection of contemporary music scores. Beyond establishing the collection, the ultimate goals of this project are to raise awareness of open access at UCLA and beyond, and to create a resource valuable to both practitioners and scholars of music.

Following the call’s close in April, a team of UCLA Library employees began the work of preparing score submission data for ingest into eScolarship, the University of California’s institutional repository. The ingest process is coordinated with repository managers at a system-wide level. Once a representative sample of the score collection is published in eScholarship, there are plans to begin promoting the collection via an online exhibition platform such as Omeka. This will allow us to curate a selection of the scores, provide context for the project, and integrate multimedia file types. Finally, we hope to go beyond providing access to the individual scores by asking contributors for derived MusicXML files, which we hope will both enhance preservation at the file level and establish a contemporary music dataset of value to scholars and composers.

","Digital Humanities (DH) projects are complex with multiple moving components in need of preservation. Early preservation planning for each component is a strategy for long-term access. This presentation will break down various components of a DH project, preservation approaches for those components, packaging methods for future recreation/emulation.","Digital Humanities (DH) projects have multiple moving components that each require their own preservation strategy. Projects begin with some form of data (text, images, csv files), that evolves into planning documentation (grant proposals, wireframes, productions plans), which leads to the project site (HTML/CSS). It can be overwhelming planning to preserve an entire interactive website as one entity. This presentation outlines our approach to breaking down a DH project into individual components, applying a preservation method appropriate to its content type, and then packaging each component together for long-term storage.

This approach relies on emulation over migration to address format obsolescence. Since each component is a unique format, and all of the components are packaged together, file format migration would be performed manually. This is not a scalable method. By planning for emulation and reconstruction of a website, we can develop a streamlined workflow for appraising, packaging, and preserving content. For this approach to be effective, documentation for each component is critical. Documentation is a driving force behind successful emulation to capture not only the technical components and decisions, but to establish a clear understanding of the goal and purpose of the project.

This presentation is the result of a test case performed on a current DH project to export and appraise the content and supporting infrastructure, apply individual preservation methods, and reconstruct the project from those components. This aligns with the conference topic Project management as we are providing a potential workflow for producing preservation-friendly DH projects.

This unconference session will be dedicated to discussing how to sustain live digital humanities projects in ways that anticipate eventual long-term preservation in a digital archive. It will also discuss how to establish pipelines for the sustainability and future preservation of DH projects, particularly in a university/college context. Despite increasing interest in sustainability over the past several years, sustaining live DH projects (equating, approximately, to the NDSA Level 4 Content Functional Area) is understudied compared to other aspects of digital preservation. Furthermore, it is often done by severely under resourced individuals and project teams or those without the necessary LIS background to understand the impact of their actions on the long-term future of their projects.

CADRE is advancing data-driven research with an open-source, cloud-based platform that opens access to big bibliometric datasets. CADRE establishes an infrastructure to store, secure, and maintain these datasets and provides a user-friendly, data-mining interface.

Libraries can take part in this shared infrastructure through CADRE’s hosted model that ensures the platform is accessible to every type of institution.

CADRE promotes standardized, high-quality data with Digital Object Identifiers, advancing reproducibility in research and improving data provenance.

Currently seeded with Microsoft Academic Graph, Web of Science, and USPTO data, CADRE also provides tools to empower individual researchers to work with big data, such as its GUI query-builder and a coding environment for creating custom data-analysis and visualization tools. Users come together in the “Marketplace” to share workflows, queries, data-analysis tools, research results, and more—and to utilize what others share.

For our proposed panel, we will share what we have learned to revise our programs.","In 2018, Wesleyan University Libraries and Information Technology Services launched the Digital Scholarship Fellows Program, an internship offering a small cohort the unique opportunity to work with experts from the Digital Lab and Academic Technology to develop the skills they will need for research in the digital humanities. Under the direction of the digital projects librarian and the director of academic technology, the students are introduced to digital humanities tools and methods, often in collaboration with other digital scholarship support centers on campus, including the GIS lab and Archives and Special Collections. Our purpose is to build a student-centric digital humanities community of practice in which students are given the resources to develop and execute their own projects. The inaugural cohort is composed of Rama Co, a junior studying College of Letters and Philosophy; Sofia Sperber, a sophomore taking up Sociology and Environmental Studies; and Philippe Bungabong, a sophomore pursuing Economics and Data Analysis. Albeit in different fields, the inaugural Digital Scholarship Fellows will collaborate in producing two DH projects that combine the disciplines of history, art, politics, and international economics.

In 2019-20, Trinity College has launched three initiatives aimed at supporting students’ digital scholarship. The first is a student advisory board, which has become a driver for programming and marketing directly to students. The first two events, on digital productivity strategies and on privacy & student data, have been among the best-attended student-oriented events that did not involve laser tag or free Chipotle. They have also offered useful correctives to contemporary marketing platitudes about the relevance of various social media platforms. A second initiative involves a student fellowship program, which provides students with money and access to specialized staff so that they can complete digital humanities projects. A special instance of this, scheduled to pilot in the spring semester, is a Thesis Sprint, which will offer students sustained support over three days in order to move a project significantly closer to completion. The third initiative is student-targeted digital scholarship studio hours, which are two hours a week in our digital scholarship space, giving students the opportunity to get drop-in help on a wide variety of research questions, and to collaborate with others on similar projects.

This panel discusses parallel student-centered digital humanities initiatives at Trinity College and Wesleyan University. Focused on partnering with students rather than simply training them, these initiatives offer new opportunities for students, IT departments, and libraries to advance digital scholarship at the undergraduate level.

Increasingly, institutions are faced with the daunting task of migrating content from one repository to another. But what strategies exist to help institutions identify suitable repositories and effectively and efficiently plan and execute a migration? This workshop aims to explore the issues and strategies of repository (re)selection and migration.

Participants will learn about the different phases of a migration process including: system evaluation and selection, migration planning, and implementation strategies and tools. Through hands-on activities and facilitated discussion, participants will actively explore these phases as they relate to their own organizational context and come away with next steps for planning for system selection and/or a migration at their own institution.

After attending the tutorial, participants will:
- Understand the major components of a repository migration
- Understand criteria for repository selection
- Apply migration strategies and methods to their organizational context
- Gain familiarity with some tools used to migrate repository content

The workshop will be led by members of the Bridge2Hyku (B2H) Project, an Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) National Leadership/Project Grant (LG-70-17-0217-17) initiative led by UH Libraries and partner institutions to support the creation of the B2H Toolkit- a suite of resources for migration planning and implementation. The toolkit includes both software that is specific to a migration from CONTENTdm to Hyku, as well as general migration guidance applicable to many types of system migration.

But what strategies exist to help institutions identify suitable repositories and effectively and efficiently plan and execute a migration? This workshop aims to explore the issues and strategies of repository (re)selection and migration.
Participants will learn about the different phases of a migration process including: system evaluation and selection, migration planning, and implementation strategies and tools. Through hands-on activities and facilitated discussion, participants will actively explore these phases as they relate to their own organizational context and come away with next steps for planning for system selection and/or a migration at their own institution.
After attending the tutorial, participants will:
- Understand the major components of a repository migration
- Understand criteria for repository selection
- Apply migration strategies and methods to their organizational context
- Gain familiarity with some tools used to migrate repository content
The workshop will be led by members of the Bridge2Hyku (B2H) Project, an Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) National Leadership/Project Grant (LG-70-17-0217-17) initiative led by UH Libraries and partner institutions to support the creation of the B2H Toolkit- a suite of resources for migration planning and implementation.

We recently launched the new Enhanced Deposit Service to help faculty get as much as possible of their research, teaching, and creative outputs into our repository. Simultaneously, we’ve developed two Jupyter Notebooks to (1) check for content already in the repository, and (2) both get citation information, including the DOI and publisher which may or may not be in the citation, from Crossref and pull rights information from SHERPA/RoMEO. The Jupyter Notebooks streamlined tasks that would otherwise take much longer by consolidating many steps into working in output spreadsheets, rather than having to access multiple online systems separately to get information for each publication. This tool allows you to see/control which Python code block is running for those with less coding experience.

Currently the collection is being digitized for access and preservation, yielding well over 3,000,000 files. Given the scope of the project, storage needs guide many decisions. The Digital Lab explored several approaches to reducing individual file size, ultimately settling on using lossless Jpeg-2000 as an archival format.

While this decision dramatically reduces our storage requirements, the impact on workflows and needed expertise is significant. In-house digitization processes utilize CaptureOne and Photoshop, which do not fully support jp2. As such, conversion adds another distinct process and layer of quality assurance which depends on a suite of tools that must be installed, learned, and maintained. One key challenge is the inability of jp2 conversion tools to preserve technical metadata, which must be copied separately. Moreover, early size-reduction strategies often present compatibility issues that must be resolved. One last concern is the ability of our preservation system to accommodate jp2, which required changes to normalization rules to prevent overwhelming the system.

When deciding to digitize over a million images, it must be assumed that some compromises must be made. Despite the additional technical debt and ongoing knowledge that must be maintained, the decision to deploy Jpeg-2000 as an archival format makes the project feasible in a way that might otherwise not be possible.

Often these records are still held by local congregations, and difficult to access. But even larger, established repositories hold important collections that often remain ""hidden."" These two separate projects: Digitizing the Records of Philadelphia’s Historic Congregations: Providing Documentation for the Political, Social and Cultural Developments in Philadelphia (2017) and New England's Hidden Histories: Providing Public Access to the Manuscripts of New England's First Churches, Incubators of American Democracy (2015) bring many of these historically priceless and often inaccessible records to public view. Although work continues, the two projects have scanned a large body of documents now freely available online for scholars and the general public. The projects take two somewhat different approaches to their online presentations: the Philadelphia records can be seen through a unified website: www.philadelphiacongregations.org and through the American Theological Library Association’s (ATLA) digital library and the University of Pennsylvania’s Special Collections online portal: OPenn. New England's Hidden Histories serves as a single centralized online location for images created in cooperation with local churches and by a significant number of established historical repositories: http://www.congregationallibrary.org/nehh/main.

We are making these documents accessible by publishing them freely online on our respective websites, transcribing them where possible. Digitization alone often does not render these documents accessible, as many either cannot read them or can read them only with difficulty.

We are engaging communities to work with these records - scholars, genealogists, students, members of congregations, and interested members of the public, and building online communities for these groups. We are bringing together scholars in symposia, placing post – event recordings online, organizing talks with local groups to promote use of the records and sharing experiences with history and archival communities, as well as the general public.

These projects give volunteers of the various congregations a forum in which they can share ideas and problems, and bring the resources of larger institutions to smaller archival repositories, enabling them to learn from each other in online forums and onsite lectures.

Next steps include applying for supplemental grants to scan additional records; expanding our offerings by bringing attention to previously scanned records; increasing scholarly and community outreach and broadening our online presence with lesson plans.

Beyond presenting an example of how form design and metadata collection processes have changed over the course of 10 years, this talk will pose questions about obsolescence, in terms of technologies and data formats as well as the impacts of staff change on institutional knowledge loss, and ultimately suggest how we might counter both.",,,"Provo, Alexandra",NYU,United States of America,North_America, ,alexandra.provo@nyu.edu,aprovo@gmail.com,alexandra.provo@nyu.edu,"Provo, Alexandra",alexandra.provo@nyu.edu,,,0,,0,,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2020-May-11 16:31,2020-Jul-27 15:06,0

This workshop will provide space for participants to consider and share their institution’s digitization selection as it relates to representation, equity, institutional mandates, and collecting scopes.","Digital collections are important. They offer remote access to irreplaceable cultural heritage; they demonstrate which holdings institutions consider to be the most important; they are increasingly being used as data, opening new means of interpretation and interaction. However, many cultural heritage institutions lack thorough strategies for selecting content for digitization, leaving professionals to make digitization decisions without a clear mission.

This workshop will open by sharing findings from an ongoing Collections as Data project that uses the Louisiana Digital Library to investigate selection for digitization within a multi-institutional digital library. The workshop leaders will then moderate a series of exercises to enable workshop participants to share digitization selection policy at their own institution and brainstorm modifications.

The workshop leaders will provide specific discussion topics with related questions about selection for digitization. For example, one question might be, “When making decisions about what to digitize, does your institution consider community representation?” Attendees will be given time to individually consider answers to the questions in preparation for a gallery walk: the discussion questions will be posted on chart paper around the room, and attendees will visit each question and informally record their thoughts. Finally, attendees will split into small groups, each of which will be tasked with synthesizing a set of posted responses. Each group will share their synthesis, which will lead to a larger group discussion about digitization selection as it relates to representation, diversity, equity, institutional mandates and collecting scopes.

Every migration of digital collections presents its own set of challenges unique to the institution and the platforms involved. Digital practitioners must think creatively and develop innovative solutions to overcome these challenges. This panel goes beyond offering migration strategies and encourages digital practitioners to undertake large-scale work on digital collections by re-framing migration as an opportunity for transformation rather than an obstacle to overcome. Panelists will share experiences with migration involving Islandora, CONTENTdm, ArchivesSpace, Knowvation, and in-house built digital content management systems. They will specifically speak to how they have taken advantage of migrations to advocate for additional resources, collaborate within and across institutions, evaluate usability, overhaul metadata, and otherwise optimize their digital collections.

Each presenter will begin with “two truths and a lie” about their migration story and poll the audience. This will create a space for both presenters and audience members to discuss missteps, failures, and sacrifices inherent to the migration process. Presenters will showcase how these lapses shouldn’t be covered up, but instead utilized for the enhancement of the repository.

These presentations will provide the basis for a discussion with the audience on concrete strategies for advocacy, effective collaboration, user research, and stakeholder management, in addition to broader inspiration to tackle transformative change.

While the former program had functional workflows, it lacked goals or internal purpose; namely, it was reactive rather than intentional. Staff turnover led to responsibility for the program being placed in our hands; when a new AUL came on board with oversight over the program, we stepped forward to suggest a review (and volunteered to lead it). We envisioned an independent program with shared, collaborative leadership: a “production” leader responsible for process management and infrastructure development and a “community” leader responsible for education, outreach, and scholarship -- and we continue to work patiently and collaboratively to implement this vision. Most importantly, our driving ethos was building a responsive program with its own ambition, agenda, and shared values. Our program seeks to engage user communities with unique digital collections, produced collaboratively, inclusively, and openly.

This presentation will outline our review and implementation process, as well as share a glimpse at our documentation. We’ll detail what roadblocks and frustrations we faced but also the moments of satisfaction (and joy) along the way. We’ll also provide some tips for other programs looking to perform a complete overhaul or even implement some minor reforms while leading “from the side.” Institutional change can be difficult and frustrating; we’ll suggest, based on our experience, some approaches to facing those frustrations with persistence and humor.

Due to Virginia Tech’s strong creative technologies program and entomology program we sought to build partnerships across these disciplines to attract and fund three graduate students to complete most of the project. The grant pays for the student’s salary and benefits, while the university covers the tuition as cost share, allowing each of the students to secure a graduate education, master a horizon technology, and graduate in two years without incurring educational debt.

The outreach and assessment strategy includes working with rural Appalachian schools to bring these models to middle school students to both promote their use, and also determine how learning with 3D models is different from learning with physical specimens. Outreach also includes working with the local chapter of the Master Naturalists program to both leverage their expertise, and also incorporate these new digital resources into their training materials for education and for certification.

Over the past decade, these residencies have become a popular way to establish collaborative relationships with the Wikimedia community. In this interactive panel discussion, librarians from three Canadian public universities will share their experiences hosting Wikipedians in residence.","Over the past 10 years, Wikipedian in residence (WiR) positions have become a popular way for library and archival institutions to establish collaborative working relationships with the Wikimedia open knowledge community. First introduced by the British Museum, a Wikipedian in residence is typically an experienced Wikipedia editor who works with an institution to both develop relationships in the community and facilitate the contribution of free open content to Wikipedia. With more than 175 examples self-reported on the Wikipedia Outreach page, there is no shortage of examples, but what we found was that each position is unique to the institutions and shaped by a variety of factors, including administrative and funding structures, labour restrictions, the role and priorities of the supervising manager, existing initiatives, and the candidate pool.

In this panel discussion, we will bring together three librarians from large, public, Canadian universities who each led the development of a WiR at their respective universities to discuss how the programs worked and what didn’t. The panel will start at the beginning and discuss how the WiR was proposed and funded, as well as the nitty gritty of developing a job description and recruiting the WiR candidate. We will also discuss how the positions varied, in response to our different institutional cultures and goals. Each institution will describe the wikipedia projects that came out of the residency which include: integrating collections to promote usage, library staff focused training to build broad based capacity with Wikipedia, and community digital literacy programming. The panel will end with a discussion on the assessment of the residencies and examples of how the residencies positively impacted their university and wider communities.

By bringing together three different perspectives on the WiR in a discussion style format, attendees will be able to see what factors shaped each position and learn about the breadth of Wikipedia activities undertaken. Attendees will leave this session with a variety of examples of Wikipedian projects that they can explore at their libraries. For academic libraries without the resources or institutional support to fund a WiR position, attendees will leave with ideas for sustainable initiatives that can be incorporated into existing workflows. In order to keep the presentation interactive and accessible, we will have an open Google Doc available for notes and questions from attendees, and we will monitor Twitter for questions. The Google Doc will then serve as a summary of the session for attendees’ future reference.

In this session, we will share a draft assessment rubric developed out of our findings to elicit feedback and discussion.","With new technologies and paradigms for creating and sharing work, scholars across all fields have seen changes in research output, dissemination and preservation of the scholarly record, emergent publishing models, and the measurement of scholarly impact. During the past two decades, academic libraries have begun to further invest in scholarly communication through the allocation of staffing and resources and even establishing institutional repositories. However, quantifying the actual outcome or impact of these scholarly communication activities remains elusive, beyond output measures such as simple counts of consultations, workshop attendance, or by repository downloads or growth.

In August 2019 Sacramento State University and San Jose State University were awarded an IMLS National Forum grant to assess scholarly communication programs at M1 public institutions. The co-PIs conducted focus groups with scholarly communication practitioners and interviewed campus stakeholders. In May 2020, we held the National Forum on the Assessment of Scholarly Communication Programs. We’d like to propose an unconference format to present the assessment rubric we developed out of this project at the 2020 DLF Forum. We would share the draft rubric with attendees, talk through the various sections of the rubric, and get feedback on what could be improved. Participants will have the opportunity to share their own assessment methodologies and take home ideas for assessment and services of their organization’s scholarly communication program.

Digital literacy has become increasingly important to the field of librarianship. Now, more than ever before, people are working with and relying on data and analytics to carry out critical duties. People from different educational backgrounds are entering data science and learning computer programming skills. However, a “one size fits all” model can leave some behind. How do data librarians or instructors acknowledge and meet the needs of this population? How can they remove barriers to success for those learners least likely to feel empowered to learn these skills?

Many people new to computer coding can feel overwhelmed. This session will discuss the current landscape of programming instruction, focusing on Python. In addition, the author will postulate questions to stimulate new thinking about how instructors might make computer programming skill-acquisition less daunting for newcomers. Drawing on personal experience, as a learner with a humanities background, the author theorizes that similar to language acquisition, people can be taught to read and understand computer code through the inherent patterns that exist within code.

This session seeks to expand perspective and drive evolution in data instruction. Common themes in computer programming instruction methods, and how these impede or empower different types of learners, will be a focus of the session’s discussion. The author will engage attendees in brainstorming and reflection on more effective ways to teach digital literacies by translating familiar structures to code, both in format and through semantics.

Pregnant parents who carry a fetus with a prenatal diagnosis have data tracked from birth to adulthood. Data includes highly sensitive information about parents, obstetrical outcomes, and children; therefore, robust privacy measures are put in place to protect participant identity in this research. The project complexity requires appropriately managed identifiers to link data from multiple clinical systems. This data is intended to fuel new research and includes medical history, obstetric history, prenatal diagnosis and management, delivery outcomes, specific surgical details, family history, biological samples, and genomic data.

OBJECTIVES: Incorporate innovative privacy practices with traditional archival workflows during and as an integral component of a complex study’s active processes.

METHODS: Engage institutional compliance officers to establish a documentable solution upholding identity management for the protocol. Make recommendations to the technical/operational team for archival practices that maintain the provenance of data linked to a given patient.

RESULTS: For this specific case, we detail archival storage plans in the research protocol. We also inform patients in “lay language” that their protected health information (PHI) will be protected by honest brokering as well as stored permanently in the institutional archives.

CONCLUSION: Professional archival practices are new in the biomedical domain, and this case study is at the forefront of defining archival best practices for highly sensitive biomedical research that ensure personal information and data are preserved appropriately, all in order to advance patient outcomes.","INTRODUCTION: The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) operates a biobank following outcomes of children with congenital birth defects.

Each resource has been submitted by a member of the project team or by the broader community, and goes through a curation and review process by community reviewers prior to publication. In 2018, the Institute of Museum and Library Services awarded the DMTC a three year National Leadership Grant for its enhancement in four critical areas:

1. Expansion of the documentation model and search capabilities to include additional attributes that have been identified by users and by a metadata working group.

2. Development of integrated assessment capabilities in the DMTC that capture improved usage statistics, UI usability feedback, and learner and instructor feedback for training materials published in the DMTC.

3. Expansion and diversification of the content of the DMTC beyond the core of Earth science and research data management skill building - the early focus of DMTC collection development.

4. Targeted outreach to the academic library community to increase familiarity with and use of the DMTC, and engage the community in the continued development and growth of the DMTC.

This workshop will demonstrate the capabilities of the newly developed DMTC by:

1. Providing an overview of the DMTC and its capabilities with an emphasis on individual and small group exploration of the interface to discover skill building materials relevant to the topic areas of workshop participants.

2. Demonstrating the submission and curation process as an opportunity for workshop participants to gain an understanding of the underlying documentation model, and the submission, review and publication workflow for DMTC content.

3. Soliciting feedback from workshop participants on their experiences using the DMTC to discover materials of interest to them, and on the presented submission, review, and publication process.

4. Inviting workshop participants to join a growing community of content creators, content submitters, and reviewers.

Learning Outcomes:

1. Outcome 1 – Workshop participants will be able to use both the browse and search capabilities of the DMTC to find skill building materials relevant to their needs.

2. Outcome 2 – Workshop participants will know how to submit materials for integration into the DMTC and understand the underlying curation process to which those materials will be subjected.

3. Outcome 3 – Workshop participants will understand the various areas in which they could potentially contribute to the community activities of the DMTC: as content creators, submitters, and reviewers.

The planned outcomes of the workshop are to bring a broader familiarity with, understanding, and use of the DMTC and its content to the academic library workshop participants; to receive actionable feedback from the community that can be integrated into ongoing planning for future enhancements to the DMTC; and to invite new participants to the continued growth and diversification of content in the DMTC by serving as content creators, submitters, and reviewers.

Our work became an essential facet of the student experience during the 2019-2020 school year when the ""Vassar Intensive Experiential Work"" initiative was officially implemented. Intensives provide innovative learning opportunities that complement more traditional courses. These faculty-mentored experiences have provided an incubator for digital scholarship that allows the value of the DiSSCo group to shine. Through collaboration we strive to fill any potential service and knowledge gaps. We provide training, expertise, and campus resources to help transform ideas into sustainable projects that can be shared, extended, and reviewed within the scholarly community. This presentation will review the organizational structure and governance of DiSSCo as well as share the many exciting projects we have participated in. The shift from support in our physical spaces to the digital during the Covid-19 pandemic will also be addressed.",,,"Scalessa, Nicole",Vassar College,United States of America,North_America, ,nscalessa@vassar.edu,,nscalessa@vassar.edu,"Scalessa, Nicole",nscalessa@vassar.edu,,,0,,0,,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,As the world of faces a pandemic collaborative efforts such as this provide useful models for agility in supporting experiential learning both in person and digitally. ,,,,2020-May-11 17:55,,0

Most recently in her position at Western Michigan University, she discovered that her previous efforts did not suit the needs of the wider cultural heritage community that sought her help and she needed to develop a new approach to support digitization efforts. This led Bocko to secure grant-funding to support building a digitization equipment lending library and student assistantship; these resources coupled with WMU’s preexisting digital library infrastructure and the educational materials/guidelines she created, have enabled local institutions digitize their materials and reach a wider audience through WMU’s collection hosting/DPLA harvesting.

In this presentation, two archivists and one librarian will reflect on over six years’ worth of promoting collaborative technical upskilling within the Curation team at the University of Michigan Bentley Historical Library. The presenters--who represent a number of diverse roles at the Bentley--will reflect on lessons learned from three consecutive initiatives: one provided opportunities for a small group to focus on a specific set of technical skills; another expanded the collaborative learning component of its predecessor by opening a variety of technical skills topics to the entire team; and still another provided an in-depth opportunity for a subteam to work on a single deliverable over a concentrated amount of time. The presentation will conclude with a “long view” of what went well, and what could be improved, with an emphasis on equity and inclusiveness. While the presenters come from a particular perspective, the audience should leave with relevant takeaways to bring to their own institutions, regardless of size or academic affiliation, and will be invited to share their experiences advocating for, promoting, or participating in technical upskilling throughout the presentation.","As archives and libraries expand their digital collections and services, acquiring or expanding technical skills is no longer the exclusive domain of individuals, although much of the professional literature on this topic might make it appear otherwise.

We support graduate students in building capacity for campus-wide training in data and computational scholarship.

To address this need, the University of Arizona Libraries allocated funding to test a proof of concept, one-year pilot with four graduate fellows. Our program, the Digital Scholarship and Data Science Fellowship (DS2F), is intended to build capacity for campus-wide training in data and computational scholarship. It address three known challenges in contemporary higher education: (1) insufficient training for data-intensive, computational research within subject disciplines; (2) uneven attention to digital pedagogy and strategies for teaching technical concepts within graduate training programs; and (3) a need for ongoing development of modular curricula that can be integrated into the classroom and extracurricular workshops or used independently by scholars and researchers at the point of need.

Our pilot launched in January 2020 with a series of workshops whereby library subject matter experts trained graduate students on technical and pedagogical skills. In turn, the students embarked on a process of self-directed learning with projects related to digital scholarship and data science, culminating in a series of open workshops that extend their knowledge to the campus community. Librarians’ instructional sessions (1) build connections between the cohort and mentors, (2) teach the basics of instructional design of short-term, modular workshops, (3) convey best practices in digital pedagogy, and (4) discuss open educational resources and open licensing. Early indicators from our pilot suggest that the model is successful and extensible to the greater academic library community.","Across disciplines, rapidly growing interest in digital and data-intensive scholarship creates a largely unmet need for critical training in technical skills.

This will involve a brief and gentle direct look at code that exhibits technical debt (eschewing casting any blame on previous or current developers -- that isn’t helpful to moving forward).

Though mandated by law, issues of accessibility are still for many institutions and practitioners an afterthought. As public organization, libraries are mandated by law to be open and welcoming to everyone irrespective of their abilities, gender, race, or sexual orientation.

Enter Geodisy: an open-source spatial discovery platform for Canadian open research data. Initially funded by CANARIE, Geodisy’s online interface provides a map-based search that is available alongside Canada’s Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR). Users search for data based on its location and have the ability to preview datasets as overlays on a digital map and access comprehensive metadata. Data is currently sourced from Scholars Portal Dataverse, which houses open research data from forty Canadian institutions.

The platform and the software behind it use both pre-existing and custom-made components, all of which are free and open-source. The code and pipeline setup instructions are freely available via our public Github repository, and other institutions are both welcome and encouraged to adopt their own instances of the software.

This work benefits all research disciplines that use geospatial location, from anthropology to zoology to climate science. The project’s next goal is to expand the interoperability of the software to include additional data sources, such as governmental open research data. In this presentation, we will share software architecture designs, metadata mapping processes, and a demonstration of the platform.

The abrupt transition to emergency remote teaching prompted us to transition the core of our Toolshop work online via the development of a series of co-learning encounters that facilitated problem-solving alongside open-ended inquiry. We wondered together, how can we support one another as we redefine our expectations, approaches, and identities as both teachers and learners? Using the topics of critical digital pedagogy, archives, and “thinking like a computer,” we were interested in expressing thoughts in, through, and about technical systems while also exploring issues such as trust, authority, and grief. We considered the ways we could release our control of the conversation without abandoning the community, as well as the capacious affordances of domestic spaces, the workings of liberatory pedagogy, and the workings of generous practice. We propose to offer a 5-minute, pre-recorded presentation of our process of reconfiguring the Toolshop model into synchronous/asynchronous co-learning experiences (made accessible prior to the Forum), and use our 15 synchronous minutes to run breakout groups (whether in-person or online) working with participants on externalizing and share their experience(s) with a piece of their own educational technology, whether the Forum takes place in Baltimore or via teleconference.","For five years, we have run a series of face-to-face “Toolshops” at the University of Pittsburgh that bring members of our academic community together in semi-structured settings to work on the aspects of our professional work driven more by the social practice of shared meta-cognitive reflection than on content-driven scholarship.

How can we responsibly use and archive big social data? This presentation suggests that robust data stewardship strategies developed to support qualitative data reuse can inform similar practices for big social data.,The ethical and epistemological challenges of research with big social data are well-established. How can we responsibly use and archive big social data? This presentation suggests that robust data stewardship strategies developed to support qualitative data reuse can inform similar practices for big social data.,"Big social data (such as social media and blogs) and archived qualitative data (such as interview transcripts and diaries) are similar, but their respective communities of practice are under-connected. Both types of research repurpose existing social data to advance discoveries in social science. Both also present challenges of context, informed consent, privacy and confidentiality, and intellectual property. However, despite these similarities, big social research has not yet been widely framed as a form of qualitative data reuse, and qualitative data reuse has only begun to be discussed through a big social data lens.

Qualitative data reuse is a more established practice, and therefore has more developed data stewardship strategies to support epistemologically-sound, ethical, and legal data sharing. Data stewardship strategies that support responsible reuse of qualitative data include data management planning, metadata schemes, and restricted access. However, issues still exist, including issues around scaling up qualitative research by combining archived data to support longitudinal studies and broader insights.

Data stewardship for big social data is less well-developed, and there is little consensus about how to maintain balance between transparency and protecting research subjects. Addressing this challenge is especially important when researching vulnerable or marginalized communities who connect via social media. While data stewardship practices could alleviate some of these challenges, such practices are still in development.

This presentation suggests that librarians and data curators can use the robust data stewardship practices that support qualitative data reuse to inform similar practices to support responsible research and archiving for big social data.","Big social data (such as social media and blogs) and archived qualitative data (such as interview transcripts and diaries) are similar, but their respective communities of practice are under-connected.

However, despite these similarities, big social research has not yet been widely framed as a form of qualitative data reuse, and qualitative data reuse has only begun to be discussed through a big social data lens.
Qualitative data reuse is a more established practice, and therefore has more developed data stewardship strategies to support epistemologically-sound, ethical, and legal data sharing. Data stewardship strategies that support responsible reuse of qualitative data include data management planning, metadata schemes, and restricted access. However, issues still exist, including issues around scaling up qualitative research by combining archived data to support longitudinal studies and broader insights.
Data stewardship for big social data is less well-developed, and there is little consensus about how to maintain balance between transparency and protecting research subjects. Addressing this challenge is especially important when researching vulnerable or marginalized communities who connect via social media. While data stewardship practices could alleviate some of these challenges, such practices are still in development.
This presentation suggests that librarians and data curators can use the robust data stewardship practices that support qualitative data reuse to inform similar practices to support responsible research and archiving for big social data.",,,"Mannheimer, Sara",Montana State University,United States of America,North_America, ,sara.mannheimer@gmail.com,,sara.mannheimer@montana.edu,"Mannheimer, Sara",sara.mannheimer@montana.edu,,,0,,0,,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2020-May-11 20:52,2020-Aug-13 17:17,0

These programs promote digital skills acquisition by creating a pipeline towards sustainable, permeable competencies in DH research and pedagogy. This pipeline also supports cross-institutional partnerships, which strengthen a shared knowledge base and extends our community of practice across campus and beyond. Since late 2014, we have collected data about our scholars—from attendance and affiliation information to more detailed information about rank, role and funding—to help us effectively respond to DH needs and trends. We will illustrate ways that specific IU students and faculty have excelled (or stalled) by tracking their paths through these programs with an eye toward assessing how programs interact as a whole.

But, without considering the organizational values, socio- technical issues and impact on society, memory organizations may repeat the same mistakes that other domains have already committed. Memory organizations need to prioritize discussions of value alignment and social concerns over optimizing operational mechanisms, especially in the context of ML because of its amplification powers.

University of Utah, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and University of Notre Dame are working on a project to understand and identify sources of bias in ML pipelines in memory institutions. Our intent is to facilitate a conversation with practitioners in the digital library community that are working with ML projects. As part of this working lunch session, based on literature review and our analysis of ML projects in memory institutions, we will summarize ML pipelines prevalent in memory organizations. Then we will frame open ended questions (examples below) to engage the audience in participation. Example questions:

What elements of the socio-technical infrastructure will need to be examined to understand sources of bias in ML projects in memory institutions.

Which forms of algorithmic bias can possibly apply to archives and digital libraries.

Members of the Recollect community curate digital repositories with contents ranging from hundreds to millions of items. Each institution enacts unique strategies for engaging their community around content while building long-lasting relationships with creators and contributors. This best-practice survey reveals the unique ways in which educational institutions collect and preserve at-risk heritage items; how indigenous groups extend their role as guardians of the past into the virtual space; and where new partnerships can pair cutting edge creatives with government agencies.

In combination with strong access policies, dynamic interfaces with context-aware data become a central tool for building a collaborative online community. At the same time, creating detailed user personas is essential for achieving maximum impact among a diverse user base. Through illustrated examples of effective policy, curation, and user management, this presentation will allow DLF attendees to consider a robust mix of tools and practices to safely grow online engagement.

These results culminated in a proposed 3D/VR preservation workflow employed by VTUL on a current 3D digitization project.,"Numerous disciplines are producing 3D and virtual reality (VR) data but without the guidance of published standards. After Virginia Tech University Libraries received a CLIR grant to digitize specimens from the Virginia Tech Insect Collection in 3D, we wanted to contribute to 3D/VR reproducibility by developing a workflow for 3D/VR preservation applicable across disciplines in the OAIS reference model.

We conducted a multi-case study in preserving 3D data in the OAIS model through interdisciplinary collaboration with several departments on campus using different types of 3D/VR datasets. The primary result is that what information is preserved has greater importance over how it is packaged for preservation. These preliminary findings indicated that the primary risks facing 3D/VR are software obsolescence, reliance on proprietary software and hardware, minimal support for popular file formats, and the lack of community-adopted standards and documentation for creation and preservation. These results are limited to samples of convenience, and collaborators providing these datasets are VT faculty. To expand on this work, I developed a survey composed of guided questions asking what data types our colleagues work with, creation and preservation methods, specific metadata schemas, and their level of documentation.

In Her Own Right project panelists examine the impact of large-scale collaboration for end-users, contributors, and participants. From metadata messes to DAMS successes, we’ll share the benefits and value we’ve gathered throughout our process.","The Philadelphia area community of libraries and archives has a long history of inter-institutional collaboration and strong local professional networks due in large part to the Philadelphia Area Consortium of Special Collections Libraries (PACSCL). In 2018, PACSCL was awarded a CLIR Digitizing Hidden Collections grant for its project “In Her Own Right: The Many Faces of Women’s Activism, 1820-1920.” The grant built on an existing foundational project and digitized collections from ten repositories. Over its three phases of production, the In Her Own Right project collaborated with a total of twenty institutions, targeting audiences including high school students and teachers, traditional scholars, and digital humanities users of raw data. The CLIR-funded phase of the project supported digitization, description, and aggregation of 9700 records and roughly 140,000 pages of content.

For the In Her Own Right project, collaboration is a means to aggregate and deliver subject-focused content to a broad audience via a unified access point for increased discovery. PACSCL’s mission is about developing a community of practice and the In Her Own Right collaboration demonstrates the benefits of working with a range of sizes and types of repositories, supporting technology growth and capacity, and sharing resources toward a common goal. This panel discussion will assemble end-user, project management, and project participant perspectives on how collaboration impacts the use and management of digital materials and lays the groundwork for expanded use of those collections.

A series of five short presentations totaling 25-30 minutes will provide the basis for discussion on collaboration value and impact. The project archivist will speak about what she has learned over two years of working with 20 repositories of varying shapes, sizes, and capacities toward the common goal of increased access. This perspective will include a look at the promise and challenge of funding that supports digitization and description, opening the question of how fully digitization projects support end-use: is traditional metadata enough? Two project participants, one representing a small repository, will discuss how the collaborative structure supported increased access, technology growth, and capacity building. Two additional panelists will talk about the use of project materials: an independent scholar will reflect on how research using a digitized collection in the context of a larger aggregate is different from using its physical counterpart; a repository participant will discuss specific cases of their institution’s materials in the In Her Own Right portal, particularly after COVID-19 caused the repository to close to the public and to most staff.

For the final 20 minutes of the session, the panelists will facilitate a group discussion on how we as content managers can leverage the power of collaboration to benefit our end users. The session is targeted to anyone interested in collaborative models, with a goal of examining existing projects to understand future needs.

In addition to CLIR, the project team sought and received funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation, and the New Century Trust.

It has become an entree to building new and meaningful relationships with colleges, departments, and campus services for whom common purpose with the libraries is not always easily visible or determined. Offering a web-hosting platform with built-in open source applications ready to use that is sufficiently flexible enough to accommodate diverse usage, positions UK Libraries as not only a service provider but also a collaborator in digital pedagogical practices and projects with faculty, staff, and students.

The archival formats need to be less human-centric and more efficient for machine consumption.,"Traditionally, digital preservation takes a repository-centric view on system design. The target of digital preservation is deposited into a repository, which also holds related metadata about them and provides discovery mechanisms. Once the desired digital objects have been identified, the end-user is expected to retrieve them from the repository and start the reuse on her own.

With the rapid growth of the scope and the scale of digital preservation, researchers and practitioners increasingly lean towards a data-centric view on its system design. The target of preservation is considered similar to research data sets, which need to be constantly interrogated, sliced and diced, scanned and transformed, and disseminated in forms unrecognizable from the deposited formats. The reuse needs to be embedded in the system, and the majority of the data manipulations have to be done by computers equipped with custom-built programs and procedures. The preservation system is therefore not obliged to preserve data in the same formats as they were deposited. Instead, the archival formats should be determined by how well they fit the purpose of the reuse. Misalignments will significantly slow down the reuse and render the preservation systems unusable for research. Open file formats are not free from such misalignment. We have recently discovered an up to 100 times speedup in analytics simply by converting the web archival files from WARC to Parquet. In this talk, we will analyze the root causes of such inefficiencies, and shift our attention to data file formats and their design rationales.

We will discuss a range of topics, from common challenges, to how physical spaces (“labs”) for software preservation are built, to decision making around technical maintenance, to how patrons can (or should) access software collections.

Of particular importance will be the theme of how software preservation work is often an extension of other forms of preservation work. Whether it is equipment used to perform digital forensics, staff that process born-digital archives, or infrastructure to maintain digital collections, the SPN Technical Infrastructure working group found that the foundations for software preservation work already existed at many institutions before a formal program began, and likely exist at many other institutions with or without current software preservation programs.

The second theme of the panel will focus on where software preservation work requires committing additional resources. The most expensive of these are staff time and collaboration across multiple divisions. Panelists will discuss how they have responded to these challenges and adapted their programs over time.

For example, dLOC’s technical team follows agile and scrum for equitably engaging stakeholders to support each according to their needs.

- Copyright: Are the collections materials protected by copyright and, if so, is the institution the copyright holder? If not, does a relevant copyright exception apply that permits creation and distribution of digital copies anyway?
- Contracts: Do provisions in gift or donor agreements limit the conditions under which digitization services or access can be provided?
- Privacy: Do the collections reveal information that could impinge upon the privacy rights of the subjects under federal and state laws?

TDM, a form of computational text analysis, is an increasingly relevant and prevalent approach to social science and humanities research. Researchers often rely on library-stewarded or licensed collections to support TDM, yet shy away from building and openly sharing diverse and representative corpora due to uncertainty around copyright and licensing restrictions. The perception of legal obstacles does not just deter research: it biases research by limiting researchers to particular topics and sources of data, leaving important questions unasked, and rendering TDM findings less broadly applicable. A growing body of research also demonstrates how race, gender, and other biases found in openly-available corpora have contributed to and exacerbated bias in the development of artificial intelligence tools.

Building LLTDM, first previewed in a 2018 DLF presentation, addresses these challenges through a framework and instructional materials for librarians and research professionals to develop copyright, licensing, privacy, and ethics literacies. Having now administered the Institute, we will leverage insights to cultivate community input and action on key calls to action surfaced by Institute: (1) moving toward TDM-friendly library licenses; (2) integrating the literacies into digital libraries to better serve computational researchers; and (3) addressing ethics at the intersection of digital library collections and computational research.","Drawing upon lessons learned from Building Legal Literacies for Text Data Mining (Building LLTDM; buildinglltdm.org), a recent NEH-funded Institute, we will overview actionable strategies for libraries to develop and implement core skills needed to navigate law, policy, ethics, and risk to better support text data mining (TDM) research.

The goal of these efforts is to arrive at a process that identifies and incorporates controlled vocabularies from marginalized communities, that respects their interests, and is not hindered by metadata formats or system technology.

One way to mitigate bias in metadata is to know about controlled vocabulary options that exist from historically marginalized communities. Within the Samvera Community, there is a working group developing guidelines and steps to determine when a controlled vocabulary is useful and how to find and evaluate a relevant controlled vocabulary for descriptive metadata creation. Another way to mitigate bias is to have options to easily incorporate controlled vocabularies for use from multiple sources. Cataloging/digital collection management applications have varying capabilities to enable term selection using different or multiple controlled vocabularies. Additionally, Linked Data vocabularies can connect terms between larger, less representative vocabularies (like Library of Congress Subject Headings) and terms from a community’s vocabulary to aid and instruct end users conducting research online. Yet another way to disrupt metadata bias is to support communities who are providing controlled vocabularies. Working through steps to discover and use controlled vocabulary options from marginalized communities helps to center those communities’ concerns by advocating to use terminology from those communities in descriptive practice and encouraging software improvements to better support varied controlled vocabulary use.","Mitigating bias in metadata is not a finite task but this talk shares experiences in identifying ways to disrupt metadata bias.

One way to mitigate bias in metadata is to know about controlled vocabulary options that exist from historically marginalized communities. Within the Samvera Community, there is a working group developing guidelines and steps to determine when a controlled vocabulary is useful and how to find and evaluate a relevant controlled vocabulary for descriptive metadata creation. Another way to mitigate bias is to have options to easily incorporate controlled vocabularies for use from multiple sources. Cataloging/digital collection management applications have varying capabilities to enable term selection using different or multiple controlled vocabularies. Additionally, Linked Data vocabularies can connect terms between larger, less representative vocabularies (like Library of Congress Subject Headings) and terms from a community’s vocabulary to aid and instruct end users conducting research online. Yet another way to disrupt metadata bias is to support communities who are providing controlled vocabularies. Working through steps to discover and use controlled vocabulary options from marginalized communities helps to center those communities’ concerns by advocating to use terminology from those communities in descriptive practice and encouraging software improvements to better support varied controlled vocabulary use.",,,"Hardesty, Juliet",Indiana University,United States of America,North_America, ,jlhardes@iu.edu,,jlhardes@iu.edu,"Hardesty, Juliet",jlhardes@iu.edu,,,0,,0,,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2020-Aug-04 17:27,,0

We will discuss new ways of using spatial data layers to infer additional metadata to enhance the searching/browsing process for users.,"Searching scientific literature typically involves using keywords or controlled vocabularies, ignoring the geographic location of where the research was done.

Under this project, undergraduate and graduate research assistants (majority POC) are hired to conduct oral history interviews with SMU’s alumni of color. The oral histories are stored in the SMU Archives and made available online in the Southern Methodist University Oral History and Digital Humanities Student Projects digital collection. 

Currently, the 200+ oral histories record the experiences of Black, Latinx and Asian students at Southern Methodist University, ranging from 1965 and the period of integration at the school to the present. Through this research, we hope to take steps towards creating a more diverse atmosphere at SMU, in addition to documenting and validating the unique experiences of alumni of color. For current students of color, knowing what their predecessors had to undergo can also be a source of validation and solidarity. 

Equally importantly, the interviews comprise a growing body of research the students are mining and presenting in a variety of venues. And, beyond numbers and diversifying SMU’s archives to promote inclusivity, the project has created research and networking opportunities for the research assistants and proven to be a positive way of engaging with alumni of color.

- Project Background: The Voices of SMU project has changed greatly over two years, both through streamlining and in response to the pandemic. This presentation will provide an overview of the partnership, including highlights, milestones, technologies, and workflows. (Cindy Boeke, Digital Collections Librarian, SMU Libraries)
- Visual Representation: Throughout Western History, people of color have often been visually depicted through white interpretations of brown, black, and yellow skin, but the representations that people of color have of themselves are often excluded. At Voices of SMU, we take innumerable steps to ensure that both the stories and the physical representations of participants are presented with dignity and authenticity, and we champion people of color by granting oratorical and visual agency. (Camille Davis, Camille Davis, PhD Candidate, SMU History Department)
- Counter Spaces: The Voices of SMU interviews demonstrate the importance of college ""counter-spaces,"" which are spaces specifically for college students of color. This presentation will discuss how ""counter-spaces"" help students of color thrive at PWIs and challenge race-based micro aggressions, as well as the roles counter-spaces play in promoting inclusivity and standing up for students of color. Finally, the challenges counter-spaces face, some of which are caused by university administration, will be reviewed. (Nia Kamau, SMU Human Rights/International Studies Major, Class of ‘22)

The web-based project consists of three categories of modular toolkits that--in combination with each other--form innovative assignments where students engage with library collections and expertise. By combining relevant critical literacies to contextualize a research project, a digital primary source packet, and a digital scholarship toolkit, faculty can assemble meaningful assignments that meet pedagogical goals for hybrid or online classrooms. Instead of focusing primarily on technical tools, we take a problem-based approach, framing the hypothetical use of a kind of digital scholarship tool in terms of their fit with subject matter and desired teaching outcomes, while also proposing potential assignments.

Our goals in this project are to demystify digital scholarship and pedagogical methods for our faculty, grow the library’s strong connection to the curriculum during a time of crisis, create new opportunities in the curriculum for Special Collections and Digital Scholarship, and share knowledge and resources with the broader professional community. The toolkits also provide a way for faculty to engage in exciting pedagogical projects while maintaining equitable access to materials for students who are unable to physically access library materials. In this 15-minute presentation, the presenters will share the design and development process for the toolkits, as well as outreach strategies and potential future directions for the project.

To address this need, the University of Arizona Libraries allocated funding to test a one-year pilot with four graduate fellows. Our program, the Digital Scholarship and Data Science Fellowship (DS2F), is intended to build capacity for campus-wide training in data and computational scholarship. It address three known challenges in contemporary higher education: (1) insufficient training for data-intensive, computational research within subject disciplines; (2) uneven attention to digital pedagogy and strategies for teaching technical concepts within graduate training programs; and (3) a need for ongoing development of modular curricula that can be integrated into the classroom and extracurricular workshops or used independently by scholars and researchers at the point of need.

Our pilot launched in January 2020 with a series of workshops whereby library subject matter experts trained graduate students on technical and pedagogical skills. In turn, the students embarked on a process of self-directed learning with projects related to digital scholarship and data science, culminating in a series of open workshops that extend their knowledge to the campus community. Librarians’ instructional sessions (1) build connections between the cohort and mentors, (2) teach the basics of instructional design of short-term, modular workshops, (3) convey best practices in digital pedagogy, and (4) discuss open educational resources and open licensing. Early indicators from our pilot suggest that the model is successful and extensible even under the current constraints of the pandemic.","Across disciplines, rapidly growing interest in digital and data-intensive scholarship creates a largely unmet need for critical training in technical skills. To address this need, the University of Arizona Libraries allocated funding to test a one-year pilot with four graduate fellows.

This requirement is often neglected, perhaps because of its complexity.","Digital libraries are expected to be built with features that recognize people with disabilities (PWD) as valued, contributing members of society. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 are internationally adopted standards to support developers create content that many people with diverse disabilities can use. As with many public organizations, libraries are required to follow these guidelines.

Our presentation addresses the fourth WCAG conformance requirement. This states organizations need to build or acquire web content that is compatible with the assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) that users with disabilities rely on to interact with the web. We draw it to the attention of the DLF Forum, because it is arguably the most complicated requirement. As the WCAG authors note, it is tied to sociological factors, including social and economic status of users.

Our presentation describes the situation this requirement puts libraries in using easy to understand and humanizing terms. We draw on our experiences as a sighted web and user experience librarian at a Canadian university and a blind accessibility specialist for the National Network for Equitable Library Service (NNELS), which provides books for users with print disabilities through Canadian public libraries.

Despite the complexity of this requirement, we offer two questions everyone can ask to make it simpler. First, we can ask about the assistive technologies people with disabilities in our communities are using. Second, when talking about web content we either develop or purchase, we can ask does it work with the assistive technologies our users rely on?","Digital libraries are expected to be built with features that recognize people with disabilities (PWD) as valued, contributing members of society.

Highlights include the collaborative efforts of project stakeholders to honor victims of racially motivated violence and the archival value of social justice informed collection arrangement and description.","The Civil Rights and Restorative Justice Project (CRRJ) at Northeastern University School of Law conducts research and supports policy initiatives on anti-civil rights violence in the United States and other miscarriages of justice during the period 1930-1970. CRRJ serves as a resource for scholars, policymakers, and organizers involved in various initiatives seeking justice for these crimes.

This panel will share the experiences of the collaborative team involved in building the Burnham-Nobles Digital Archive, which builds on CRRJ investigative records to create a public archive and database. This archive will be presented on a website which provides access through functions that center the victims, allowing family members and researchers to continue seeking justice and understanding of racially motivated violence.

The Burnham-Nobles Digital Archive, by furthering the CRRJ’s mission of restorative justice, shows how digital projects and archival records can honor families and communities who have endured racial violence. The archive is being built by a collaborative team of experts with diverse specialties in law, historical and legal research, and archival and information science -- meeting the CRRJ's vision for this archive requires institutional commitment and support for building a broad team. The work of the Burnham-Nobles Digital Archive team is centered on record-keeping as accountability for past racial violence and its ongoing effects today.

The project is nearing the end of the design process, using the expertise of CRRJ investigators, archivists, metadata experts, digitization specialists, data engineers and website designers at Northeastern University Library. The collection organization, metadata structures, and technical infrastructures next move into a testing phase which will evaluate both functionality and methods used to center the victims represented in the collection.

Raymond Wilkes will first discuss the CRRJ project’s investigate method, approaches to data and organization, current restorative justice projects, and the relationship between the investigator and archivist. Gina Nortonsmith will next discuss mission-driven archiving as represented in the CRRJ project: designing systems which represent and honor real people. Her presentation will touch on stakeholder dialogue and coordination of needs between CRRJ and the library, project management which straddles multiple library departments, and developing strategic technical directions in partnership with CRRJ project leaders. Amanda Rust will follow with a discussion of methods for facilitating the connection between project stakeholders and the data engineer and software developers that will build and refine underlying databases and new interfaces in support the CRRJ. Then, Drew Facklam will represent her work on this project from the perspective of metadata creation and its effects on the interoperability between the University's MODS-based Digital Repository Service (DRS) and the specialized collection-specific archival site. Finally, panelists will end with a Q&A reflecting on lessons learned throughout the project.

The Collaborative Archive & Data Research Environment (CADRE) will create an affordable, cloud-based platform that provides institutions of any size—and even members of the general public—sustainable access to big bibliometric data. CADRE stores, secures, and maintains big bibliometric datasets on the platform while providing a user-friendly, data-mining interface and data analysis tools.

Indiana University Libraries, in partnership with the Indiana University Network Science Institute and the Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA), formed a cross-industry coalition, including nine other BTAA library institutions, to create CADRE. Libraries can join CADRE through a tiered-pricing model, which includes a free tier of access.

The platform is currently seeded with Microsoft Academic Graph and the Web of Science and provides tools that empower individual researchers to work with big data, such as a GUI query-builder and a coding environment for creating data-analysis and visualization tools. Users come together in the “Marketplace” to share workflows, tools, research, and more—and to utilize what others share. CADRE promotes standardized, high-quality data with Digital Object Identifiers, advancing reproducibility and improving data provenance.

We invite DLF attendees to test CADRE’s free tier of service and share feedback on what they believe will make CADRE—a platform built on collaborative principles—the solution to all academic libraries’ and researchers’ big data research needs.","The hefty price of big bibliometric datasets and the infrastructure required to support them prevents many academic libraries from providing the resources to their patrons and the broader community.
