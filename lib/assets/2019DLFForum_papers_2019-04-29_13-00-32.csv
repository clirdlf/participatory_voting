This committee will better enable us to leverage our strengths, promote collaboration and develop shared user experiences across our repositories.","The U-M Library has a long history in the digital realm. U-M Digital Library Production Service was created over 20 years ago as an entrepreneurial effort towards managing and hosting digital materials. The Deep Blue institutional repository followed as a means to provide broad access to research without publisher intervention. More recently, Deep Blue Data was launched as a related but distinct repository to provide support for researchers in sharing and preserving their data. And U-M Publishing built Fulcrum, a platform for hosting ebooks and associated digital media.

Up until recently we treated the development and operation of our repositories in isolation, but have formed a new steering committee to bring us together. In an era of reduced resources and with a recognition of the power of collaboration, we see distinct advantages in developing shared functionality, common policies, and consistency of user experience. Our steering committee is building alignment for a suite of connected services in the mission of the Library and developing a deep understanding of the missions and experiences of each repository. We are not a centralized body with control over the services we offer; direct authority is maintained by the unit responsible for the work. Instead, our purpose is to find ways to continue to serve user needs by finding commonalities and reducing barriers to enable us to accomplish more collectively than we could individually.

We look forward to a lively audience-led discussion about how they have approached their organizational structures in providing repository services.","The U-M Library has a long history in the digital realm.

When shedding a light on data collection and analytics, the BA team deployed a seamless and efficient workflow to manage the different operations related to digitization, data entry, reviewing and maintaining integrity to the metadata processes while enforcing different access level for the back-end users.

State of the art techniques were utilized to provide a user-friendly experience, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for digitized text objects and tiling for ancient maps visualization. In addition, specialized viewers were developed for the various media types.

These archives-adjacent positions, which may be structured, organizationally, throughout various archival and non-archival departments, illustrate how information professionals work across and between the boundaries of traditional archival roles and responsibilities and other forms of library work. Panelists will present case studies on a variety of topics: digitization services management and digital library programs and their interactions with archives and special collections; visibility of labor in distributed services and cross-departmental collaborations; engaging the public in the archival process while respecting the expertise of archivists; the impact of archival acquisitions on staff and operations of institutions; and learning experiences from accidental archivists. These case studies will not only highlight varied and unique professional practices/experiences, but will center a spectrum of perspectives offered by panelists coming from both large, medium and small institutions/organizations, suggesting “adjacent” positions are not specific to any one type of archive, but considered useful and even critical to the operations of most archives.

This panel includes a range of institutional perspectives, from a public library to large and small and public and private academic libraries. Additionally, panelists have a range in experience- some panelists have been in the field for many years, while others are relatively early career. All panelists identify as women and come from a variety of racial, class and geographic backgrounds. Key takeaways from the panel will include strategies and lessons learned on building successful collaborations and projects with and across archival repositories, how to make labor more visible within and in relation to archives, exposition of various tools, software, and systems employed by speakers in their day-to-day work, as well as highlight any specialized skills required for or cultivated in this work.","This panel session will feature speakers who occupy “archives-adjacent” positions at their institutions, where their work may involve or be impacted by archival collecting, processing, and access, but “archivist” and its associated duties are not explicitly part of their job responsibilities.

While the use of authority lists is common in metadata workflows, creating them presents a host of challenges for determining what to document and why. Documenting glaciers as entities manifests many of these considerations in marked ways as glaciers straddle ontological boundaries - they can be both objects, places, and events. This is particularly true when they are considered as events, as climate change continues to accelerate the shifting boundaries and locations of glaciers and their effects on other entities. In an era of rapid change and destabilization, what is the role of the authority list in anchoring documentary practices to the unfolding of events around them? To this end, I will present a working ontology for modeling the changing aspects of glaciers with an aim for demonstrating the reusability of this event-oriented ontology towards new contexts.","The University of Colorado Boulder Libraries and the National Snow and Ice Data Center recently completed a CLIR grant to digitize and make available a collection of over 25,000 glacier images from around the world.

The current structure of cultural heritage preservation institutions—libraries, archives, historical societies, museums, monuments preservation organizations, etc.—has evolved over several centuries, entirely shaped by a pre-digital world. It is a loose network of institutions with limited funding, local constituencies and expectations, and, while often collaborative, with largely uncoordinated strategies for collection and preservation. Through the end of the last century, coverage of the world’s documentary heritage in its many pre-digital forms, while not ideal, had evolved to a predictable pattern. Coverage was considerably enhanced by the ability to collect retrospectively, to actively seek out and rescue materials previously overlooked. This is a modality that no longer works in the disruptive born digital world. The collective resources of our institutions are insufficient to the full scale of the digital collecting task, a scale potentially made larger by a need to collect “just in case” because there will be no “just in time” for an unforeseen demand.

While the act of collecting (or retaining in archives) is not synonymous with preservation, it is an essential pre-requisite. Even as digital preservation professionals toil energetically and brilliantly to devise means to address technical preservation challenges, the outcomes of their work are necessarily limited by the capacities of their parent institutions to curate and collect born-digital content. The challenge of preserving digital-only content needs to be met within a feasible, realistic economic and institutional context, determining highest priority strategic initiatives for limited resources.

In light of the disruptive challenges of the digital-only environment, we are at a critical juncture to re-examine the societal and institutional framework that serves to collect and preserve documentary evidence. At minimum, such an examination can lead to a more broadly shared set of priorities and expectations about what should be captured and preserved, better focusing future efforts; at best, it can identify additional players and resources to extend the capacity of society to preserve its story.

This panel will begin with a presentation that looks at the history and existing framework for the current preservation environment and consider where it does, and does not, match 21st century challenges. The presentation will frame issues for a panel of commenters with expertise and/or perspectives from: a library special collections, a specialized repository, a national library, community and personal archiving.

It further supports goals to involve more diverse voices in the development of workflows and to streamline processes in order to better serve the community.

In June 2017, the State Library of North Carolina’s Government & Heritage Library began an extensive evaluation of its digital content management. In the first stage, an interdepartmental working group determined high-level functional requirements for digital content--from acquisition to preservation to access--and conducted an evaluation of the primary tools used. The second stage, included interviews with catalogers, agency liaisons, and digital staff resulting in a complete workflow chart of current processes. The third stage, consisted of a workflow analysis and the development of solutions for prominent breakdowns and issues. Now in the final stage, the project focuses on implementation. In this presentation, library staff will provide a project overview, lessons learned, and tactics used in analyzing our workflows and tools.

Through the process we found that an openness to exploration and evaluation fostered good collaborations across disciplines and among different professionals. By taking the time to step back, to look at workflows, to evaluate who is involved and what is used, we have better positioned ourselves for future projects, collaborations, and problem-solving.","Analyzing workflows is a vital component to ensuring reliable, long-term preservation, access, and support to collections.

In the first stage, an interdepartmental working group determined high-level functional requirements for digital content--from acquisition to preservation to access--and conducted an evaluation of the primary tools used. The second stage, included interviews with catalogers, agency liaisons, and digital staff resulting in a complete workflow chart of current processes. The third stage, consisted of a workflow analysis and the development of solutions for prominent breakdowns and issues. Now in the final stage, the project focuses on implementation. In this presentation, library staff will provide a project overview, lessons learned, and tactics used in analyzing our workflows and tools.
Through the process we found that an openness to exploration and evaluation fostered good collaborations across disciplines and among different professionals. By taking the time to step back, to look at workflows, to evaluate who is involved and what is used, we have better positioned ourselves for future projects, collaborations, and problem-solving.",,,"Green, Andrea",State Library of North Carolina,United States of America,North_America, ,andrea.green@ncdcr.gov,,"andrea.green@ncdcr.gov, krista.sorenson@ncdcr.gov","Green, Andrea;

Campus networking, course implementation, assistance with digital research, and strategic initiatives on campus, have all contributed to building capacity for a successful program. The past three years have been spent by networking with faculty at events and by building trust between the library and the DLA librarian to be willing to risk to implement digital projects into courses and/or scholarship. Furthermore, the implementation of digital projects into coursework has enabled the furthering of digital projects on campus by teaching digital liberal arts methodologies and skills to students and faculty. This, in turn, has resulted in additional projects in and outside the classroom by faculty and students. Finally, strategic initiatives across the campus have encouraged the implementation of digital liberal arts and “public facing” projects. At the three year mark, there has been quantifiable success in the program and yet, it’s time to consider future initiatives and programming to ensure furthered success and capacity building.

The U.S. Government Publishing Office (GPO), founded in 1861, is an agency in the legislative branch of the U.S. Federal Government that has printed and distributed official Federal publications since its inception. GPO began its efforts to digitize these historic U.S. Government publications in 2015 and continues to make these important resources available to the public through its preservation repository, govinfo (https://www.govinfo.gov).

GPO’s digitization efforts face an obstacle not found in many institutions; GPO does not have an onsite library collection. Instead, its collection is distributed among the over 1,000 Federal depository libraries across the U.S. and its territories. The Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP), a program managed by GPO, has provided access to content produced by the U.S. Federal Government since the early 19th century. The FDLP has a historical mandate to provide access to content produced by the U.S. Federal Government through its network of geographically dispersed libraries.

GPO is the first institution in the United States and the second worldwide to receive ISO 16363 certification for govinfo (https://www.govinfo.gov). Through govinfo, GPO provides free public access to official publications from all three branches of the Federal Government.

In this session, staff from GPO will share their strategies and workflows for tackling the hurdles presented by the lack of an onsite tangible collection and other unique features of working with Government publications.

Staff will begin by sharing strategies for titles which are either acquired from Federal depository libraries for destructive digitization or borrowed from libraries or other Federal agencies for non-destructive digitization. The presentation will focus on GPO’s ongoing effort to digitize a collection of 18,000 congressional hearings. Staff from the GPO unit that manages govinfo will discuss how changes were made to the existing day-forward congressional hearings collection to accommodate the digitized hearings. This project included working with a digitization vendor to test the govinfo metadata specifications by digitizing a small sample of the hearings. With the metadata requirements known following the govinfo changes, staff will share our workflow for inventory and physical condition assessment of the hearings collection. Finally, we will end with a status update on these digitization efforts and include a demonstration of the digitized hearings in govinfo.","Congressional hearings and other publications from the United States Government are among the most significant primary resources for the history and policies of this country.

Following an introduction to the theories and methodologies in the field, participants will get hands-on practice with the major components of a text mining project.","The relationship between close reading, mid-range reading (Alison Booth, “Mid-Range Reading: Not a Manifesto,” 2017), and distant reading (Franco Moretti, “Distant Reading,” 2013) has expanded the scholarly potential of both literary studies and the social sciences. As academic libraries continually shift to keep up with changing research and pedagogical needs, many are looking at the digital humanities as an opportunity for closer collaboration with faculty and other campus stakeholders. The text mining of primary sources fosters a natural partnership between library staff, faculty and students.

The purpose of this workshop is to familiarize attendees with the basic workflow, terms and output a student or new researcher would encounter when trying to accomplish a text mining project. We will give an introduction to text mining, including: what it is, what’s possible, and how it is being used for research and instruction. In addition to a discussion on the theories and methodologies in the field, participants will get hands-on practice with the major components of a text mining project.

Participants will build mini-projects in order to familiarize themselves with the fundamental steps of text mining: 1) the curation of a textual dataset, 2) the cleaning and preparation of that data, 3) computational analysis, and 4) visualization of results. To accomplish these tasks, we will provide a sample dataset, but will also include a list of primary sources (found on the Web and in the library) where they could procure their own datasets. Using one of the most popular text mining and visualization tools used by digital humanists today (Voyant), attendees will work in groups to generate visualizations from the texts in their datasets, and answer questions based on their results.

This workshop is an introductory session covering the basics of text mining where no previous background is required.

This talk will provide an update on year one of the two-year grant.","Libraries and archives have increased concerns over the longevity of physical audiovisual formats due to media degradation and obsolescence, combined with the decreasing cost of digital storage. This has led many institutions to digitize recordings for long-term preservation and improved access. Simultaneously, the growth of born-digital audiovisual content, which struggles with its own issues of stability and imminent obsolescence, has skyrocketed.

This has put a spotlight on the increased need for better access to audiovisual content. One reason audiovisual recordings are not widely accessible is the lack of sufficiently granular metadata to support discovery, use, and informed rights determination and access control decisions for collections staff and users.

We propose that full descriptive access to audiovisual objects at scale requires mechanisms (both automated and manual) working together to analyze media and their associated materials (such as transcripts or transcribed carrier information) to generate meaningful metadata that supports discovery, navigation, rights determination, and permissions and access decisions. These mechanisms might include natural language processing, speech-to-text conversion, facial recognition, music detection, manual description, object recognition, and more.

This presentation will explore our problem solving around migration, metadata, UI, and more to support these sometimes conflicting purposes.","From its launch in 2012, Paul V. Galvin Library managed Illinois Institute of Technology’s institutional repository, an installation of Dspace. In 2016, the library was concerned with the technological sustainability of the software, and whether Dspace offered the features and experience that users expected. We began to explore other options. At the same time, the library’s University Archives and Special Collections unit was experimenting with Dspace and other software as platforms for sharing digitized and born-digital content across our 1,100+ archival collections, something that the library had never offered. Facing issues of financial restrictions and uncertain staffing, we determined that we didn’t have the bandwidth to simultaneously launch two different systems. That year, we started a migration of our IR to Islandora, intending for this single instance of the software to serve both purposes.

This presentation will explore our solutions to and mitigations of the challenges inherent in migrating existing material and metadata into an Islandora-based IR and those presented by the sometimes conflicting purposes of this single instance of Islandora. I will discuss our problem-solving process for issues such as metadata, user interface, search & discovery, permissions, and collection structure. I’ll also explain our workflow for keeping some archival content restricted to staff in a system built with a premium on streamlined access. Finally, I’ll share where we seem to have succeeded and what early reactions indicate needs more work, and invite questions and discussion from the audience.

This affects data reuse not only in how the data themselves are selected for preservation but what and how contextual information (metadata as well as documentation) surrounds the data. In this presentation, we will discuss data reuse in the archaeological, zoological, and quantitative social science communities. We will not only discuss what contextual information is needed, but why certain types of contextual information are sought by members of these disciplines.

Our findings indicate that the reasons for needing contextual information align with classic data quality indicators: accessibility, completeness, credibility, data producer reputation, ease of operation, interpretability, quality, relevance, and trust in the data. However, while all attributes were present across the three disciplines, overall the disciplines valued each differently and used different criteria or constructs to assess each quality indicator. For example, quantitative social scientists talked about completeness in two very different senses: depth and breadth of the data set and missing data points. Zoologists primarily referred to the completeness of data in reference to specimens. For zoologists, ‘complete’ data meant the ability to aggregate different types of specimen data from different sources, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), GenBank, museum databases, and their own observations of the physical specimen.

We conclude with two major takeaways for repositories. Data curators need to understand disciplinary traditions and conceptualizations of evidence to contextualize data and understand not only what, but why researchers need context for reuse.

In software development literature, the TD metaphor is used to explain how a product that may not yet be deemed “perfect” might still be released. In libraries and archives, this framework for analysis is relatively new with respect to digital projects, yet the hallmarks of TD are eerily familiar. It can manifest as incomplete metadata, lack of documentation, and/or workflow inconsistencies, while the “interest” on the debt may grow over time, often complicating future use/migration/upkeep. We argue for a new LAMS-based TD model that considers factors like metadata quality, digital production standards, collection modeling, and repository design. This approach to TD will provide librarians and archivists with a framework to help with appraisal/reappraisal of digital assets, project management, and migrations.

We argue for a new LAMS-based TD model that considers factors like metadata quality, digital production standards, collection modeling, and repository design. This approach to TD will provide librarians and archivists with a framework to help with appraisal/reappraisal of digital assets, project management, and migrations.",,,"Corrin, Julia",Carnegie Mellon University,United States of America,North_America, ,jcorrin@andrew.cmu.edu,,"jcorrin@andrew.cmu.edu, dfjoyce@syr.edu, lmcphee@ucsd.edu, rebecca.hirsch@yale.edu, rjohn211@uncc.edu","Corrin, Julia;

SUL understood the challenges they faced as they embarked on the project. These included:
- SUL does not have an established digital preservation program or librarian solely dedicated to digital preservation.
- SUL acquired a preservation system (Preservica), but needed support to transfer 100+ TB of data in an efficient way that reflects their storage and maintenance requirements
- SUL has legacy and current data in different formats, on different storage, described in different ways.
- SUL needed a way to transfer preservation data on expensive spinning disk to less expensive tape.

SUL engaged AVP to work together to address these challenges. The project included the following activities to:
- Establish a clear understanding of SUL’s current practices, policies, workflows, personnel, technology, and collections.
- Develop and draft workflows for pre-SIP, SIP creation, and ingest into SUL’s instance of Preservica and their LTO Library, based on their specific needs and collections.
- Develop and draft a digital preservation policy to support and expand digital preservation activities at SUL

Teaching students digital preservation techniques and finding inroads to gathering their materials in the short time they are part of university life takes an intentional, collaborative, and multidisciplinary approach that respects student agency and voices. In this panel, we will discuss a number of concerted, ongoing efforts to connect with student content creators, successes and growing pains in building outreach and education programs, and methods for teaching digital preservation techniques to busy students with varying interest levels. The panelists will also discuss how collaborative program development across disciplines and inclusive of community members has been essential to the success of the programs. This session will include a mix of practical techniques and lessons learned, with a focused opportunity for open discussion with the audience in the spirit of open collaboration.

Our panelists include Annalise Berdini, Digital Archivist for University Archives, Valencia Johnson, Project Archivist for Student Life, both of Princeton University; Elvia Arroyo-Ramírez, Assistant University Archivist at UC Irvine; and Christiana Dobrzynski, Digital Archivist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

Annalise and Valencia have been working together over the past year to create workshops and presentations for students on personal digital archives techniques, in the hope of educating students to preserve their materials while also building potential collection-building opportunities. They have also each been involved separately in other similar projects -- Annalise in a Research Data Management workshop for Princeton graduate students, and Valencia with Elvia Arroyo-Ramírez in building student-specific archival toolkits.

Elvia Arroyo-Ramírez recently collaborated with UC Irvine’s Cross Cultural Center to develop an Archivist-in-Residence program. The program’s aim is to create a space for members of student organizations to learn about accessible digital archiving techniques; learn about existing student organization collections the University Archives; and transfer student organization records to the University Archives. The successes of this program have led to new collaborations with campus partners, new archival collections for student organizations, and ongoing discussions about the past and present life of student organizations.

While serving as College Archivist at Bryn Mawr College, Christiana Dobrzynski supported student-led documentation and visibility initiatives, including the establishment of Archivist and Historian officer positions in student government and campus organizations, oral and public history endeavors, personal digital archiving and records management workshops, and a curatorial liaison program between the Black cultural center/residence hall and Special Collections. These much needed discussions and partnerships between student communities and the College Archives helped to re-center student voices within and to complicate canonical “College history,” which informed new guidelines and policies regarding how students wish to be documented (or not), along with their preferred descriptive language, access levels, and administrative agency.","Students are one of the most prolific creators of digital content on university campuses -- and yet, due to the highly ephemeral nature of their materials and often low-priority collecting status in many repositories, the preservation of student materials is at risk.

In this session, the presenters will discuss the development of project plans and implementing project management concepts for a variety of projects, including medium- and large-scale digitization and born-digital projects.

The session will open with an overview of project management practice including the project charter, project plan, milestone development, communication plan, tracking project activities, and project close-out. The discussion will also include how to handle the unexpected and keep the project on-track. Using moving image and recorded sound projects as case studies, these concepts will be applicable to digital practitioners working with all types of materials.

Drawing on experiences with the American Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB), a national public broadcasting community collecting effort, Rachel Curtis will discuss the opportunities and challenges associated with this collaborative, community-based project. Included in this discussion will be: the importance of project planning and documentation in the development of workflows; and leveraging open source tools for the efficient processing of preservation files. Focusing on both moving image and recorded sound collections within the AAPB, the discussion will explore the added challenge of coordinating with project partners, multiple donors, digitization vendors, file types, metadata standards, and integrating this project into the wider goals of the Library of Congress. Ms. Curtis will also discuss lessons learned and how these lessons have informed ongoing activities with the AAPB.

Focusing on the development of born-digital workflows, Laura Drake Davis will discuss efforts at the Library of Congress to automate workflows and the components needed to facilitate automation. The discussion will include materials acquired as gift collections including working with donors to negotiate format and metadata received. The discussion will focus on the value and impact of project planning and workflow development for small- and large-scale moving image collections and the use of open source tools to accomplish project goals. The discussion will include a lessons learned section and how those lessons are incorporated into ongoing and future projects.

Following the presentations, participants are encouraged to engage in discussion facilitated by the presenters to share their own experiences with attendees and ask questions. ","Project planning and project management are key elements to the success of any project, but are especially important for projects associated with digital content. Assessing digital files and surveying the available and needed resources are the first steps toward developing an effective project plan and realistic outcomes. In this session, the presenters will discuss the development of project plans and implementing project management concepts for a variety of projects, including medium- and large-scale digitization and born-digital projects.
The session will open with an overview of project management practice including the project charter, project plan, milestone development, communication plan, tracking project activities, and project close-out. The discussion will also include how to handle the unexpected and keep the project on-track. Using moving image and recorded sound projects as case studies, these concepts will be applicable to digital practitioners working with all types of materials.
Drawing on experiences with the American Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB), a national public broadcasting community collecting effort, Rachel Curtis will discuss the opportunities and challenges associated with this collaborative, community-based project. Included in this discussion will be: the importance of project planning and documentation in the development of workflows; and leveraging open source tools for the efficient processing of preservation files. Focusing on both moving image and recorded sound collections within the AAPB, the discussion will explore the added challenge of coordinating with project partners, multiple donors, digitization vendors, file types, metadata standards, and integrating this project into the wider goals of the Library of Congress. Ms. Curtis will also discuss lessons learned and how these lessons have informed ongoing activities with the AAPB.
Focusing on the development of born-digital workflows, Laura Drake Davis will discuss efforts at the Library of Congress to automate workflows and the components needed to facilitate automation. The discussion will include materials acquired as gift collections including working with donors to negotiate format and metadata received. The discussion will focus on the value and impact of project planning and workflow development for small- and large-scale moving image collections and the use of open source tools to accomplish project goals. The discussion will include a lessons learned section and how those lessons are incorporated into ongoing and future projects.

A doctoral granting University, with three separate campuses, two of which are Osteopathic and Allopathic medical schools. Some Rowan librarians and the Division of University Research led an effort to better understand the research data management (RDM) and digital scholarship (DS) needs at the University. With the continued growth in student enrollment, from 8,000 a decade ago to over 17,000 today, and the recent Carnegie research reclassification, Rowan University Libraries responded by hiring a new Director of Research Engagement and Scholarship to guide the library to meet the new and evolving research needs at the University.

Policies must be formulated, storage strategies articulated and implemented, material classified, organized and ingested, and audits performed. Basic bit-level digital storage itself is often a scarce resource - and everyone says storage isn’t preservation. What’s an archivist to do?

Don’t despair -- you may already have a nascent digital preservation program sprouting in your organization, waiting to be uncovered and nurtured. Collection development policies may be in place, ready to be repurposed for digital preservation criteria. The bit-level storage you are using may already meet some basic preservation requirements - conversations with your local systems administrator can clarify what you have, illuminate what’s already being done for you, and highlight gaps. Existing digitization workflows can be tweaked and expanded to deliver reports on file formats, checksums, and other useful preservation technical metadata.

During this presentation, we will cover in broad terms an approach we are developing for the University of Wisconsin System - a network of campuses that range from two large R1 research universities to several smaller campuses that serve regional communities. We are facilitating communication within and between campuses, in an effort to share resources and knowledge among system campuses with a great range of resources and expertise. Our goal is to help all the campuses, small and large, get on the path to develop local digital preservation programs suited to each institution’s needs and capabilities.

By taking advantage of cloud-native capabilities, like serverless computing, the scale and flexibility of cloud environments can be leveraged to meet preservation needs without sacrificing the cost benefits of the cloud.","As cloud technologies become prevalent, well understood, and well accepted, we are beginning to see academic and cultural heritage institutions choosing to forgo traditional digital preservation environments and services to make direct use of cloud storage systems for the management of digital content. Among the many advantages cited for this approach are greater institutional control, lower cost, and the opportunity to leverage the many tools and services provided by cloud vendors. These advantages are not trivial, and in the next 5 to 10 years we are likely to see many more institutions make this choice.

Moving to cloud storage from systems that are purpose-built to manage the preservation of digital content often means that many preservation-focused capabilities are sacrificed. Thus, the content managed in cloud storage is at greater risk unless steps are taken to ensure that the preservation tools migrate to the cloud as well. This does not mean running legacy preservation software systems in the cloud. Those systems frequently make operating assumptions that do not fit into the cloud model. Even those systems that use the cloud often limit the ability of the content owner to utilize their own content. What will be needed instead is a new crop of tools that are built specifically for managing the preservation of digital content that is in cloud-based storage. This talk will explore common preservation use cases and consider how they could be addressed using cloud-native tools in Amazon Web Services, the most popular cloud system.

Woodruff Library (AUC Woodruff Library) supports the teaching, learning and research missions of four institutions of higher learning that comprise the world’s largest consortium of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Like many mid-sized institutions, after a decade of building digital collections and providing access to scholarship, the Library had outgrown its existing platforms for content management. Starting in 2017, we embarked on a multi-faceted project to evaluate, select and migrate both archival collections and scholarly content to a new digital collections management system. After selecting a hosted version of Islandora to replace two legacy systems, we leveraged team members' strengths to collaborate with vendors, revise metadata schema/workflows and migrate over 50 collections of content while balancing workloads to ensure delivery of a superior product. Session attendees will gain insight on how a mid-sized academic library was able to plan, design, and implement a new digital collections management system while staying on-time, within budget and flexible to avoid project pitfalls. Presenters will touch on all phases of the project including selection and evaluation of product options, working with the vendor on building and designing the system and establishing workflows for standardization of metadata and migration of content. The presenters will also share lessons learned around working with vendors, project management, the importance of documentation and simple tools that were employed to help to streamline workflows and metadata normalization.

Woodruff Library (AUC Woodruff Library) supports the teaching, learning and research missions of four institutions of higher learning that comprise the world’s largest consortium of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Like many mid-sized institutions, after a decade of building digital collections and providing access to scholarship, the Library had outgrown its existing platforms for content management. Starting in 2017, we embarked on a multi-faceted project to evaluate, select and migrate both archival collections and scholarly content to a new digital collections management system. After selecting a hosted version of Islandora to replace two legacy systems, we leveraged team members' strengths to collaborate with vendors, revise metadata schema/workflows and migrate over 50 collections of content while balancing workloads to ensure delivery of a superior product. Session attendees will gain insight on how a mid-sized academic library was able to plan, design, and implement a new digital collections management system while staying on-time, within budget and flexible to avoid project pitfalls. Presenters will touch on all phases of the project including selection and evaluation of product options, working with the vendor on building and designing the system and establishing workflows for standardization of metadata and migration of content. The presenters will also share lessons learned around working with vendors, project management, the importance of documentation and simple tools that were employed to help to streamline workflows and metadata normalization.",,,"Hogan, Joshua",Atlanta University Center Robert W.

Though the minor is a product of successful DH initiatives on campus, we find ourselves struggling with the implications of what we have built. Because we wanted to appeal to students across campus, we purposely named the minor something that wasn't ""Digital Humanities."" As part of that appeal, we emphasized in our proposal and promotional materials that the minor provides marketable skills for a range of majors and careers. So far, this approach has been effective in drawing student interest, particularly students from career-oriented or pre-professional majors.

While we are glad to be providing students with skills they find valuable on the job market, the fundamental goal of the minor is to equip students with information literacy, critical reflection, and metacognitive skills that will make them more effective scholars, citizens, and human beings. This goal is not incompatible with an emphasis on marketable skills, but it presents several challenges that we continue to struggle with as we refine the minor: How do we meet student demand for instruction in digital tools and competencies while still ensuring that students recognize the value of more abstract critical and metacognitive skills? How do we communicate to administrators that our program involves intellectual inquiry and scholarly engagement? How do we create meaningful assessment practices that prioritize the skills we value most?

This presentation will describe our program and the challenges we have identified, outline how we have addressed those challenges thus far, and discuss our ideas for moving forward.","Last year, our small liberal arts university library launched a minor in digital culture and information.

We’ve shifted toward API’s and integrations, modular design, and identifying specific use cases to curate our portfolio of work. Our projects are becoming smaller. Technical debt has been reduced. We are shifting to collect user stories instead of infinite project requests. The MIT Libraries’ path involved understanding the current state of digital library portfolio through a product inventory, inspecting the current state of technical debt, prescribing sunsetting criteria and developing a set of proto-personas to put concrete user needs at the center of our work. We’ve built up our capacity for project management, business analysis and product management. Principles and governance for systems architecture were put into place, along with best practices for software engineering, portfolio management, and blended agile project methodology. We map new work to the persona served by a given project, and are redirecting effort toward emerging user needs. MIT’s approach blends perspectives from project management, user experience, software engineering and business analysis--which might be applied across teams of any size.","This presentation will share methods for prioritizing digital library efforts.

Part one will focus on applying topic modeling and named entity recognition to characterize and explore contents of removable storage media (e.g. floppy disks, optical media).

Participants will learn about and gain hands-on experience with products of the BitCurator NLP project, which developed software for libraries, archives and museums (LAMs) to extract and expose features (e.g. people, places, organizations, events) in text extracted from born-digital materials. The services and methods can be used by LAM professionals for appraisal and description, as well as facilitating a wider range of access and use scenarios.

Our target use cases differ from previous work in two fundamental ways. First, disk images are internally complex and require a significant software dependency stack that is already available through the BitCurator environment and BCA Webtools. These include the ability to read, mount and provide access to the contents of various filesystems, as well as extracting, presenting and reporting on their data and metadata.

A second distinguishing factor is that disks may contain a broad range of file types and data encodings, requiring substantial pre-processing to extract content so that it can be processed by NLP tools and organized into meaningful reports, access points and visualizations.

In addition to hands-on activities, there will be discussion of how the featured tools might fit into the workflows of participants' institutions.

It will facilitate participants toward more successful collaborations with faculty, across departments, and via consortia.","Collaboration makes up an increasingly important part of library work. Librarians are called to collaborate with faculty, other units or departments, and local communities, as well as via shared services, consortia, and membership organizations. A hallmark of this collaborative work is that it is often cross-organizational, whether between two units on an academic campus or between multiple geographically-disparate partners on a shared set of goals or principles. Communicating between and building relationships across groups adds additional layers of complexity to the already complicated process of collaborative work. Still, even though collaborations are notoriously difficult to foster and sustain, library staff can develop skills and techniques to improve the outcomes of their cross-organizational collaborations.

Building on a panel discussion from DLF 2018, this workshop will equip attendees with skills for collaboration and cultivate awareness about best practice in collaborative efforts. The instructors have first-hand experience leading and assessing collaborative projects from a variety of lenses, including as organizers, instructors, researchers, and funders of collaborations both small (such as 1-on-1 with a faculty member), and large (such as international consortia). After the panel and discussion at DLF 2018, the speakers analyzed the outcomes of the session and developed a framework for addressing librarian-involved collaboration. The framework shapes the themes and activities that will be addressed in this workshop, and it includes the basics of collaborative work, power dynamics, impact and overload, and sustainability

Attendees will participate in discussion and skill-building around the four main themes listed above. They will address topics such as credit and attribution, empowerment and agency, cross-community impact, and maturity models. Activities will include round-table discussion, case study analysis, and guided reflection, all of which will allow learners to apply the framework both to examples of GLAM collaboration and to their own work. We anticipate significant peer-to-peer learning as attendees share what has worked, and what has not, in their own collaborative endeavors.

The audience for this workshop is DLF attendees who practice collaborative work. There is no additional proficiency level required to participate. Instructors require access to a projector and screen.

During this session, participants will work on a competency we call the “zoom reflex,” which asks them to consider collaborative work within the context of their local interactions up through large-scale library initiatives. It is our goal that by thinking intentionally and strategically about collaborative work, attendees of this session can feel more confident and better prepared to engage in cross-organizational collaboration on both the micro- and macro-level. Doing so will prepare them to be better partners in research or tool-building projects—to which many library digital scholarship service models endeavor—and also more adept participants in the myriad of consortial groups to which their library may belong.

Through an IMLS National Digital Platform Project Grant (LG-70-18-0168-18), Northwestern University has convened a diverse team of digital preservation practitioners to create a toolkit to assist in curating digital materials. By Digital Preservation 2019, the grant team, will have drafted a curation toolkit that will assist organizations at every level to successfully implement collaborative and ongoing curation of digital content. The toolkit has a particular focus on streamlining the selection process for distributed digital preservation; however the resource will be of value to programs operating at various levels.

This panel-length session seeks to present the draft curation toolkit and solicit discussion and feedback. The grant team believes that any tool that purports to be for the benefit of the digital preservation community should be created in collaboration with the community. As such, we propose a participation-focused session led by members of the grant team. After a brief summary of the curation toolkit, the remainder of the session time will be devoted to discussing, reviewing, and evaluating the toolkit. This will be accomplished through small group discussions and hands-on activities. In addition to providing feedback on this nascent tool, session attendees will be encouraged to consider various digital curation issues and how these apply to their own organizations. After Digital Preservation 2019, members of the grant team will implement the community feedback collected throughout the session into the final curation toolkit, which will be made available on the NDSA’s OSF site after the conclusion of the grant.","A significant challenge to digital sustainability is curation: the initial selection of materials to be preserved, as well as the ongoing decisions that must be made in order to achieve long-term preservation.

This presentation examines the complex ethical and legal issues and ever-evolving workflow of digitizing and providing public access to such a collection.,"Over the past two years, rhetoric concerning US immigration policy has become increasingly inflammatory. In response a group of university professors and concerned citizens formed Otay Allies (now Detainee Allies), and began writing to migrants held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center (OMDC) in San Diego, CA. Migrants responded, describing their decisions to leave their home countries, their journeys to the border, and life in detention. In fall of 2018, CoreCivic, the for-profit company administering the detention center, began requiring all visitors to sign non-disclosure agreements and suspended their stakeholder tours. In addition, OMDC does not allow incoming telephone calls to the detainees. Thus, these letters are one of the only means of communication with the outside world. Otay Allies, realizing the importance and impact of this living archive, donated the growing number of detainee letters to the San Diego State University Library under the condition that the Library redact the letters and make them publicly available for research online.

This presentation examines the complicated process of building and caring for this archive. Since the correspondents are still being held in detention, and could be deported at any time, their privacy and safety is our primary concern. We therefore must balance the desire to promote these compelling stories with the need to safeguard and protect the correspondents. The complex ethical and legal issues surrounding the letters create a complicated, ever-evolving workflow in which mistakes could lead to serious consequences for an already vulnerable population.","Over the past two years, rhetoric concerning US immigration policy has become increasingly inflammatory.

Since 2015, Fedora 4.x has been the officially supported version of the software, but most of the community is still using earlier versions of Fedora.

In 2018, DuraSpace was awarded a planning grant (LG-72-18-0204) by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) to investigate the barriers to upgrading the hundreds of U.S based libraries and archives running unsupported versions of Fedora. Reliance on the older versions of Fedora puts at risk the stability, security and functionality of the content and services of these repositories.

Among the deliverables of this grant are:

* An environmental scan of literature pertaining to software migration,

* Profiles related to the needs of institutions migrating between unsupported to supported versions of Fedora

* A review of tools currently available to aid in software migration

* A review of the API standards of the most recent version of Fedora

* A review of the Oxford Common File Layout, an application-independent system of digital file organization that may have a positive impact on data migrations.

* Recommendations for easing upgrades, overcoming obstacles to migration

The grant team held initial meetings to discuss obstacles to migration, in which they identified issues with metadata standards, underlying system tool issues, and user interface interactions as specific points of concern. The grant team developed a survey and conducted interviews with community members in order to determine the most significant barriers to migrating to the community-supported version of Fedora. The results of this survey and interview process will help to identify common obstacles to moving from older versions of the Fedora software to the more recent and supported versions. Based on feedback from community members, the team leading the research into migration barriers between versions of Fedora will be able to not only identify the main issues, but provide recommendations for overcoming these barriers. These recommendations could include: migration tools, an upgrade guide, further documentation, training procedures, and consultations with community members. Ultimately, the goal of the survey, interviews and this panel discussion is to identify, address and propose recommendations to overcome the obstacles, and at the same time alleviate the concerns of the community surrounding the process of migrating from one version of Fedora to the next.

The panelists will discuss the major project discoveries and outcomes of the interview and survey results. The panelists will also discuss the recommendations for migrating from one version of Fedora to the next. This panel will provide an opportunity for the community to learn of the work being done to resolve the issues preventing migration, and to give feedback back to the grant team. The panelists will also lead a discussion regarding barriers to upgrading repositories more generally, will challenge assumptions about these barriers, and will present a community-oriented approach to solving the problems.","Hundreds of libraries and archives in the United States and abroad use Fedora to deliver cultural heritage and special collections-related content and services to patrons, and to disseminate research data and scholarly publications.

The dream of making rigorously validated documents the backbone of the Web never fully materialized. Is XML therefore passé? Many libraries have invested heavily in XML, having created storehouses of metadata and other documents in various XML formats such as Dublin Core, MARCXML, METS, MODS, TEI and others. As a result, libraries still need to access, process, share, search and display that content, whether for internal needs or public use. When digital library teams develop web applications for such purposes, by far the most common approach is to take a general-purpose programming language (Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby) and utilize one of the many popular frameworks for creating web applications in that language. In this scenario, whenever it needs to read XML data, the programming language has to translate the XML into a structure it can understand natively, typically an object model in the case of object-oriented programming languages. This approach is so common that we normally don’t even question it. But there is an alternative: Instead of using a programming language that forces our XML data (square peg) into its data model (round hole), what if we used a language that is custom-built for working with XML natively? This talk will describe advantages of using an XML-centered technology stack in libraries and dispel some myths about XML in our present technological context.","It’s been 20 years since XML arrived on the scene and quickly became the most hyped technology since the World Wide Web itself.

Natural language processing and machine learning can assist archivists and researchers. The panelists will discuss development of tools and methods for email curation, joining forces to pair academic research and government records management perspectives.","Personal correspondence has long been a window into important moments and decisions for historians, scholars, and citizens. With wide use of email as a personal correspondence format, archivists find themselves challenged to not only preserve a variety of associated formats, but also to provide access to researchers that is transparent and maintains contextual relationships, while still retaining the ability to restrict and redact confidential information. Adding to the challenge is the sheer bulk of data contained in these accounts, making processing and describing email accounts in a timely and sustainable manner difficult for cultural heritage institutions. One possible solution to these challenges is the use of natural language processing and machine learning to assist archivists and researchers in identifying email messages for access, processing, and, restriction.

The panelists in this presentation represent institutions developing and testing tools to meet the challenges of email curation, bringing together academic research and government records management perspectives. Cal Lee and Kam Woods from UNC Chapel Hill and Camille Tyndall Watson from the State Archives of North Carolina represent the Review, Appraisal, and Triage of Mail (RATOM) project, a collaboration funded by the Mellon Foundation to develop new software and workflows that will help institutions identify email in born-digital collections, review email sources for sensitive or restricted materials, and perform appraisal and triage to identify and annotate records. The project explores the use of machine learning to separate irrelevant emails from those that should be preserved, and will apply natural language processing methods to identify topics of interest so the messages can be tagged for improved organization and retrieval.

Joanne Kaczmarek from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign will also present on Processing Capstone Email Using Predictive Coding, an NHPRC-funded partnership between UI and the Illinois State Archives to develop and demonstrate a reliable, sustainable method of identifying and providing appropriate access to email messages of state agencies that have enduring value. Similar to TOMES, the Illinois project has taken a Capstone approach to identifying archival email. Once email has been appraised as archival, the project has worked with experts in the areas of text analytics and e-discovery to explore technology-assisted review techniques, including predictive coding, to parse and classify email messages.

Finally, Chris Prom, also from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, will speak on the broader implications for NLP, machine learning, and predictive coding for digital preservation and email archives, based on the findings of the Mellon Foundation Email Task Force, recently published by CLIR.","Personal correspondence has long been a window into important moments and decisions for historians, scholars, and citizens.

To ensure its continued relevance and success, the lab team has invested considerable energy in developing its technical expertise and services, building connections with faculty, and promoting the lab across our campus community.

The important connective role of the library’s liaison librarians vis-a-vis faculty has made them a natural focus for these efforts. The lab team has followed several strategies not only to foster close ties with liaisons, but also to empower them to promote the lab to faculty (and, indirectly, to students) and collaborate comfortably with them on digital scholarship projects. Internally communicating and marketing these digital scholarship services to liaisons became essential as a way to boost confidence and competency to sustain these endeavors. These strategies have ranged from a summer digital-scholarship training program to a blog and RSS feed for sharing tips, tools, and project updates.

At this session, attendees will learn about these strategies for fostering liaison advocacy for digital scholarship, their impact, and the goals and challenges that brought them about. The discussion will also provide attendees with strategies for working with the liaison librarians at their own institutions. Panelists will include Marquette’s digital scholarship librarian, marketing/outreach librarian, and liaison librarian for history, English, foreign languages, and philosophy.

The primary focus of scholarly inquiry was the unpublished manuscript (ca. 1550), consisting of 73 unbound individual plates. The critical importance of details on recto and verso, scribe marks, pencil lines, ink, watermarks and paper texture required the creation of extremely high-resolution digital files. Those files were critical for research by scholars at different institutions and required a secure platform throughout the development process, but were always intended to be made available once the development process was complete.

It involves the intersection of multiple departments within an institution to develop, maintain, and constantly improve the acquisition procedures, technical infrastructure, ingest workflows, and metadata requirements necessary for digital preservation of the nation’s audiovisual history. The Library has developed new workflows for audiovisual content to deal with an ever-changing landscape of digital preservation, one that has shifted from digitization and preservation of analog objects, to the acquisition and preservation of born-digital files. In 2017, the Library formed a Digital Content Management section (DCMS) to establish relationships and liaise between many sections of the Library with digital collections. This discussion will be structured in a bottom-up approach, beginning with a look at a specific preservation project, expanding to explore the digital preservation workflows of the National Audiovisual Conservation Center (NAVCC), and finally, looking at Library-wide polices and strategies related to digital preservation.

Panelists are Rachel Curtis, Laura Drake Davis, and Jesse Johnston. Rachel and Laura are Digital Project Specialists at the Library of Congress based at the National Audiovisual Conservation Center (NAVCC) in Culpeper, Virginia. Rachel works on the American Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB), a collaborative project with WGBH to preserve and make accessible public media. The Library operates as the preservation arm of the AAPB. Rachel will discuss how this project has been a test bed for many of the digital preservation processes now in place at the Library’s NAVCC facility and how her work intersects with the archival and public media communities.

Laura works with born-digital material acquired by the Library from gift and copyright deposits. She will discuss the technical processes developed at the library to ingest born-digital content and how those processes have evolved over time. She will also discuss the essential relationships she’s built with the many and varied departments across the Library that impact digital preservation and connecting with Library staff and experts who have deep technical knowledge of the systems in place at the NAVCC.

Jesse Johnston is a Digital Collections Specialist with the Digital Content Management section (DCMS) at the Library of Congress based in DC. The DCMS has a mandate to support the coordination of policy and processing of various digital collection content across the Library. With a role that encompasses both stewardship and management, one of the primary tasks of the section has been to establish relationships and liaise between many sections of the Library. Jesse will discuss this work to support and extend practices that advance the Library’s Digital Strategy and Digital Collecting Plans, as well as the development of Library-wide statements of digital preservation and digital collection management guidance. He will discuss some of the work DCMS has undertaken to facilitate conversations, collate practices and policies, and support the Library’s ongoing support for digital preservation.

Following the presentations, participants are encouraged to engage in discussion facilitated by the presenters to share their own experiences with attendees and ask questions.

Led by a team made up of members of the Libraries’ departments of Open and Digital Scholarship Services, Information Technology, and Metadata Services, this migration is a highly collaborative yet distributed project. While the amount of content we are migrating is not huge (approximately 10,000 items), the variety of content types (articles, data sets, theses and dissertations, presentations, white papers, etc.) and workflows we need to account for create quite a bit of complexity. In addition, in order to avoid duplication of efforts and ensure interoperability with other related systems on campus, the Libraries team is working closely with the Faculty Information System group in the Office of Faculty Affairs that oversees the campus faculty profiles system built on VIVO (CU Experts) as well as the hub for faculty publication data that relies on Symplectic Elements (CU Boulder Elements). This work is intended ultimately to lead to full integration of the CU Scholar repository with the CU Experts and CU Boulder Elements systems. While some of the challenges we face are relatively unique to our environment, many are generalizable to other repository migrations. As this presentation will take place very close to our deadline, we will be in a unique position to share our successes and failures with the community.","This presentation will detail the philosophy, process, and workflows involved with the migration of the University of Colorado Boulder Libraries’ CU Scholar institutional repository from bepress to Samvera on the tight timeline of almost exactly one year. Led by a team made up of members of the Libraries’ departments of Open and Digital Scholarship Services, Information Technology, and Metadata Services, this migration is a highly collaborative yet distributed project. While the amount of content we are migrating is not huge (approximately 10,000 items), the variety of content types (articles, data sets, theses and dissertations, presentations, white papers, etc.) and workflows we need to account for create quite a bit of complexity. In addition, in order to avoid duplication of efforts and ensure interoperability with other related systems on campus, the Libraries team is working closely with the Faculty Information System group in the Office of Faculty Affairs that oversees the campus faculty profiles system built on VIVO (CU Experts) as well as the hub for faculty publication data that relies on Symplectic Elements (CU Boulder Elements).

Jessica Wagner Webster will discuss her recent research addressing collaborations between information professionals and research faculty on digital humanities projects. She surveyed practitioners regarding their perceptions of working with their colleagues in other fields, the outcomes they achieved, and the issues that arose. How do these collaborations unfold? Who initiates the projects? Have information professionals begun to adjust and adapt their work to support specific DH projects, or to make their content more appealing and easy for potential future DH projects? What administrative hurdles are faced during the collaboration? Do they intend to collaborate in future? She will also discuss a follow-up research project that drills deeper into issues around labor, resource allocation, and administrative support from an archives/library perspective.

Becky Thoms will present on her work with Utah State University Libraries' Digital Initiatives Unit, which supports the full range of the libraries’ digital efforts including digital history collections, digital exhibits, the IR, and myriad digital scholarship/digital humanities collaborations with faculty and students. Her presentation will focus on the challenges of managing a full portfolio of projects while balancing the expectations of both campus and community partners with a mission to provide work experiences that respect the time and effort of both full-time staff and part time student employees. The discussion will include the inevitable tension between the goals to provide opportunities for meaningful work including skills development and engagement and meet the project and production benchmarks that are used to assess our work.

Jenny Kreiger manages a group of faculty-led digital projects meant to build collaboration between the University of Oregon Libraries and the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art, UO’s campus art museum. Since October 2018 she has collected data on the amounts and kinds of labor these projects require from staff and graduate students across the two institutions. This data is already being used for immediate process improvements at UO, and it has the potential to inform resource allocation for anyone managing digital projects in the GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, museums) sector.

Kate Thornhill's work emphasizes digital projects sustainability through a workplace sociotechnical lens. Since February 2018, she has been working for the UO Libraries Digital Scholarship Services Department to develop digital scholarship projects management operational procedures for the UO Libraries Digital Scholarship Center Faculty Grant Program, an initiative that fosters partners with UO faculty in the production of open humanities and social science digital research and education scholarly works. Her talk will focus on how she has facilitated and implemented the program’s project work with the newly formed Digital Strategies team, a cross-functional specialist team that includes professionals from across libraries.

The project focuses on improving collection access and content discovery to enhance African American studies research.","What do you do when researchers cannot find what they look for in a rapidly-growing digital collection? This presentation will discuss an ongoing collaborative project at the University of Florida (UF) Libraries to overhaul its digital oral history collection. Since it was first created in the 1990's, the collection has amassed nearly 5,000 records and expanded into over 100 sub-collections. The UF Oral History Program conducts interviews, then deposits the audio files and transcripts within the UF’s Digital Collection. This project-by-project process has resulted in insufficient and inconsistent metadata, creating a barrier to collection discovery. To use the collection, researchers must have preexisting knowledge of interview content to locate relevant materials.

The first phase of the project, which began in fall 2018, focuses on improving metadata for the recently unveiled Black Oral History Archive. The project team leverages functional and subject specialist expertise in metadata curation and African American Studies research, alongside content expertise from the Oral History Program staff. Together, the team is improving the collection’s discoverability by assigning a selection of Library of Congress subject terms to each record, revealing topic areas hidden within the interview recordings and transcripts. The project builds a solid foundation for re-designing the collection structure to match researchers' information retrieval patterns.

Besides co-presenting on the project's processes, outcomes, impacts, and next steps, the team leaders invite attendees to brainstorm alternate ways of speeding up the process and resolving the metadata quality issue from the roots.

We will discuss what that may require. The panel will also discuss a methodology for keeping the LoP updated on an onging basis.,"By the time of DigiPres, the revised Levels of Preservation (LoP) will have been shared with the broader community (Summer/Fall 2019). In addition, the Teaching and Outreach subgroup will have been formed and its charge and desired course of action for additional products and related materials deliberated. This panel will discuss the revised LoP - new additions, updates and clarifications, various “views” into the guidelines, and additional possible products related to the LoP.

Any level of practitioner of digital preservation will find this panel valuable, from novice to expert, since the LoP encompass the broad spectrum of preservation practice. Of particular value will be different approaches to crafting “views” on the document. Everything from keeping the original grid format to exploring expanded modules for the LoP—even concepts for the user experience such as a guided pathway through the LoP and/or a “choose your own preservation adventure” track. The greatest challenge for the LoP Reboot is to make final products that can be of use by any level of preservation practice.

We have heard that practitioners want to preserve the simplicity of the original LoP while, at the same time, adding various components that will extend them. This poses significant challenges to the expression of version 2.0. This new version should take advantage of newer user experience technology to be of broadest possible use. What that might look like and how we could achieve it, and what level of funding might be required will be a primary topic for this session. A secondary component of the panel will focus on the methodology for updating the LoP going forward so that the guidelines remain relevant and useful as the preservation landscape shifts.

Of particular interest will be the conversation around elements of the LoP which have surfaced over the course of our work—namely the roll of assessment and the need for the more overt addition of risk factors within the implementation of the LoP. Participants will discuss if there are any additional elements that need to be added and if current elements have the appropriate amount of clarity. Users across disciplines will also help us gauge the effectiveness of the new version and discuss possible ways the LoP can be used by administrators, curators, budget managers, archivists, and preservation experts.

Finally, the panel will engage the participants in a discussion around the best means to harness the global interest and energy we have witnessed in this process to keep the LoP a living document. What role can the NDSA play in this regard? What does the community want and need on an ongoing basis? How do we keep this work moving forward and incorporate new trends, challenges, and technology in the process?

","Street art is quickly proliferating in Reno, Nevada. University of Nevada, Reno librarians partnered with local art organizations and street artists to create an online archive and virtual reality (VR) experience of the street art, exposing it to a wider audience while simultaneously preserving it.","Reno, Nevada is currently experiencing a revitalization related to an explosion in population brought on by new industry in the area. Downtown and “Midtown” neighborhoods are being transformed at a highly accelerated rate as housing prices climb and new citizens crave the unique Reno urban art experience provided by local and visiting street artists. The neighborhoods are richly diverse, and the most popular muralists/street artists in Reno represent a variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. The recent proliferation of street art in these neighborhoods, coupled with the ephemeral nature of street art, inspired librarians at the University of Nevada, Reno to capture images of and metadata about the art in order to create a digital archive. In addition, the Libraries wanted to increase awareness of the art movement in an effort to connect to the community through the creation of an online digital exhibit and VR experience.

The Libraries’ Digital Initiatives Unit and Digital Media Technology Department partnered with an art historian, local art organizations, and Reno street artists to create an online archive, exhibit, and virtual reality experience highlighting the explosion of urban street art in Reno. The Libraries assembled a team that photographed the art using traditional 2D digital cameras, and captured 360 VR footage of the art and of several artists creating interior and exterior murals. The team conducted on-camera interviews of prominent street artists in Reno; collected permission forms; generated metadata; preserved the images and created an archive using CatDV, the Libraries’ media asset management system; and will make the images and metadata available through the Libraries new Islandora installation in early 2018. The archive will be discoverable through the UNR Library website and DPLA via the Mountain West Digital Library. The team is actively marketing the project through social media, interviews with local news agencies, events, and online and print graphic materials. By providing an archive that is accessible to students and community members, the Libraries supports scholarly research in urban street art and creates ties with local communities.

This presentation will offer details about the workflow, equipment, software, manpower, and community outreach involved in creating and implementing this project. Examples of the media release and metadata forms that were used in creating our records will be provided, as well as the metadata schema and technical specifications utilized to archive and preserve the image and interview A/V files.

Learning Outcomes

Attendees will be able to:

• Consider ways to reach out to communities to gain support (and permission) to archive local art installations.

• Learn about the technology and software needed to capture images and VR footage of street art, and how to make the images discoverable through an online archive.

But how can we know whether those solutions have been operationally successful or not? While quantitative techniques of hashing and signatures are available to assess objective preservation outcomes regarding the integrity and authenticity of digital streams, there are no equivalent qualitative measures applicable to more subjective, higher-order functional characteristics such as epistemic meaning or experiential behavior. Back in 2006 Clifford Lynch asserted that digital preservation assessment was “a metric that’s defied measuring.” This presentation provides an update on research progress towards a theoretical framework for deriving measurable metrics. The framework is based upon a conceptualization of the preservation domain not merely as a narrow problem of technical data management, but more expansively as a vehicle for human communication spanning temporal, technical, and cultural distance. The ultimate goal of that preservation is widely accepted as focused on future accessibility and usability. Those terms, however, are rarely defined in sufficient detail or nuance. Given that use is inherently contingent upon time, place, person, and purpose, we cannot restrict evaluative considerations to a single canonical form of use, but only manifold uses. Analysis of the wide variety of those uses is simplified by modeling preserved resources as persisting sets of functional affordances, e.g., form, context, performance, meaning, referents, understanding, etc. Individual metrics, or at least specific metrical principles, can then be developed for each affordance category.","The digital preservation community has developed a robust and mature set of practical tools, systems, services, and workflows to ensure the ongoing viability of managed digital resources.

Analysis of the wide variety of those uses is simplified by modeling preserved resources as persisting sets of functional affordances, e.g., form, context, performance, meaning, referents, understanding, etc. Individual metrics, or at least specific metrical principles, can then be developed for each affordance category.",,,"Abrams, Stephen",Harvard Library,United States of America,North_America, ,stephen_abrams@harvard.edu,,stephen_abrams@harvard.edu,"Abrams, Stephen",stephen_abrams@harvard.edu,,,0,,0,,,4,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2019-Apr-26 15:34,2019-Apr-26 15:40,0

One of the primary challenges in archiving active, contemporary research is finding ways to collaborate with scientists that enhances rather than disrupts the research process. Addressing this challenge requires re-imagining data stewardship partnerships, archival appraisal frameworks, and creative development of how a digital preservation program serves a given community.

The Research Institute of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) has launched the Arcus program, a major strategic initiative dedicated to making CHOP’s petabytes of siloed research data more broadly available within the institution and providing novel approaches to aligning digital preservation with proactive data integration and reuse, including linking clinical, genomic, and biospecimen data to enable new research and advance improvements in healthcare. Joining expertise across research data management, data curation, records management, agile application/software development, machine learning, cloud computing, and computational archives as a new transdiscipline, the Arcus program is staffed by archivists, librarians, information analysts, cloud computing engineers, programmers, statisticians, and privacy experts.

A major focus of Arcus has been developing a streamlined archival data ingest pipeline and workflow that aligns with and improves existing scientific research habits, all while ensuring the integrity and authenticity of born digital data so that any contributions to the Arcus Archives may be meaningful for continued use by the data creators and for near- and long-term reuse by others.

This candid session will focus on lessons learned, practical techniques, demos, and recommendations that may be applied to the wider community, with focused opportunity for ongoing audience discussion with the intention of honoring shared agency and innovation across disciplines. Our panelists include Christiana Dobrzynski (they/them), Digital Archivist; Stephanie Huang (she/her), Research Informatics Programmer/Analyst; and Perry Evans (he/him), Bioinformatics Scientist; all from the Arcus team within the Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics at CHOP’s Research Institute.

Christiana, Stephanie, and Perry have worked together to activate intrinsic partnerships across the data lifecycle to create an innovative framework for research data stewardship through an archival lens. The ingest pipeline they have developed for transforming large volumes of research data into contextualized and preserved archival collections relies on significant shared agency across their three roles, as well as with the scientists who actively create, use, and share the data.

In their role as Digital Archivist, Christiana ensures that Arcus research data collections are processed and preserved with the goal of supporting reusability, establishing supporting archival and digital preservation standards and workflows, and cultivating relationships with scientists to understand their continued preservation and access needs.

As Research Informatics Programmer/Analyst, Stephanie develops software applications to aid the Digital Archivist in their workflow and decision-making, and helps ensure that data is efficiently and reliably stored on the cloud.

Utilizing his experience as a Bioinformatics Scientist, Perry Evans develops research data organization templates and adapts genomic metadata standards to facilitate automating of the ingest pipeline.","Much like social and cultural heritage, scientific research documents exploration, discovery, and innovation.

By deliberately engaging with design thinking strategies, teams can envision previously unimagined approaches, and communicate more effectively with stakeholders about which solutions will best solve problems and fit relevant contexts. Using a deliberate design process can also make product development more democratic, giving voice and weight to the ideas of those who are often not heard. Without a deliberate process, decision making often becomes a free-for-all that tends to favor the loudest and most confident voices in a conversation, further marginalizing any team members or stakeholders who are already on the margins.

A design sprint is a five day process for solving problems and testing ideas. Borrowing heavily from the Design Thinking movement popularized by IDEO, Design Sprints further distill and structure the design process into a recipe that can be followed even by teams without much design background. At Data Curation Experts, we have been experimenting with deliberately incorporating design sprints into our work, to ensure the team is aligned on what we’re building and why, and to test and refine our initial ideas to ensure they will work for users. We have been using even smaller iterations of the design sprint process when we need to make choices during product development, which has sometimes led to unexpected but serendipitous solutions.

In this talk we’ll share our experiences, successes, and missteps with this technique, and propose ways it can be incorporated into your local project.

When libraries, archives, and others in the information field began to work on the problem of digital preservation, they were often pioneers because there wasn’t commercial or business interest or need in the same problem space. However, this is no longer the case. Many businesses now have petabytes of content for which they need to ensure integrity and replicate. Most modern filesystems include features to ensure block-level bit-integrity. Large storage infrastructure often leverages software as an abstracted filesystem and many of these systems include services for block- and/or file-level bit-integrity.

By moving what we might consider to be bread-and-butter digital preservation application functions to lower parts of the infrastructure stack and adopting approaches used by the commercial sector, we can start to decrease the directs costs of digital preservation.

While this alone does not make digital preservation sustainable, the complexity of the technology overall should have an inverse ratio to sustainability. When combined with other changes, such as robust selection and appraisal and implementation of tiered preservation commitment, digital preservation can be sustainable.","The field of digital preservation is nearing a critical juncture where we can no longer put off solving questions of sustainability.

The session will conclude with a discussion of theoretical and practical changes in descriptive practices for digital archival collections.","Since its arrival in the archival profession almost 15 years ago, More Product Less Process (MPLP) practice has informed the workflows of many archives. The theory advocates for minimal processing in order to decrease backlog and provide greater access to collections. It is not uncommon for collections to be described at the folder, box, or collection level. But what happens when MPLP practices (originally intended for physical materials) transition into the digital realm? This session examines the impact of MPLP on digital collections from preservation, to description, to discovery and access.

After a brief summary of MPLP approach, this panel will present four case studies that explore the impact of MPLP on digital collections. Each will include a concise summary of institutional legacy and current practices as well as technological infrastructure for contextual purposes. Presenters will share how MPLP has shaped digital collection workflows at their respective institutions and explore positive and negative ramifications. The panel will also share recent workflow adjustments and plans for future practices to counteract the adverse implications of MPLP. Common threads will be woven through the case studies, including challenges related to integrating DACS description into the digital library environment, providing sufficient contextual metadata for minimally described collections, and meeting the growing expectations of the communities represented in the materials as well as the communities we serve.

Rebecca Pattillo (University of Louisville) will compare usage of two digitized photograph collections by examining Google Analytics and reference request data. One collection is described minimally while the other has descriptive item level metadata. Pattillo will also explore other variables, such as research value, subject matter, and local vs. international significance, that may impact use of the two collections. Cory Lampert (University of Nevada Las Vegas) will share findings from a similar comparison of digitized collections, but her presentation will share the results of harnessing usage analytics to inform and improve UNLV’s digital library interface. Lampert will also discuss the impact of MPLP on linked data within UNLV digital collections. Rachel Gattermeyer (University of Wyoming) will share her experience on providing online access to and preservation of over 10 TB of born-digital materials while working within the MPLP framework. She will address risk management considerations in regards to copyright and personally identifiable information. Sarah Dorpinghaus (University of Kentucky) will discuss the results and impact of over 10 years of mass digitization of large minimally described archival collections. She will focus on the challenges of discoverability due to the lack of descriptive metadata as well as digital library and finding aid viewer design challenges.

The panel will conclude with a 15-20 minute facilitated discussion. It will open with questions and comments from the audience with the intent of soliciting shared experiences and ideas for adjusting short-term workflows and practices. It is hoped that the discussion will take a theoretical direction and explore ideas for shifting future practices related to description of digital collections.

","Large, long-term projects generate research that can be lost after publication is complete. At this critical juncture, the end may be a beginning. The Location Register and Linked Data Project created at Emory University seeks to preserve the research of The Letters of Samuel Beckett for future scholarship.","The Critical Junctures: Preserving Research and Making It Accessible

Large and long-term projects generate research that may be inaccessible or even lost after publication is complete. At this critical juncture, the end may also be a beginning. With publication of the final volume of The Letters of Samuel Beckett (2009-2016) came the question: how can the primary research of over thirty years be preserved for future scholarship? Metadata provided a methodology that respects literary rights while describing the letters and indexing their contents; it can preserve and open the research of the edition to new inquiry.

A Location Register of the letters was the first step toward preservation of the cumulative knowledge of the project. In it, archival descriptions and locations can be browsed by recipient, physical description, sender and recipient addresses, language, repository, collection, and previous publication. The first release of the Register was developed in collaboration with over 25 American literary archives; work is proceeding with international collections.

A Linked Data Project is the next phase. Over 16,000 letters from Samuel Beckett were collected and transcribed, but the selected edition published only about 2500. The Linked Data project will index the content of each letter: persons, places, organizations, productions, publications, and Beckett’s writing, translating, directing, reading, attendance at events. The data will be curated and enhanced with chronologies, profiles of major recipients, filmed interviews, and visualizations to invite inquiry and new research.

The Emory Center for Digital Scholarship partnered with The Letters of Samuel Beckett to establish a workflow for the Linked Data Project. An early decision was to place the content of the letters into XML files that could be marked up using Oxygen XML Editor. Oxygen’s Author Mode allowed project participants to tag entities mentioned in the letters without writing code. Another decision was to synchronize identifiers in the XML to external spreadsheets in Google Sheets that contained additional information about tagged entities. The proposed panel will consider the implications these decisions had on preservation and access. While the original system was sufficient for generating a significant amount of data, the lack of a centralized database meant that querying and editing the data was a cumbersome process. Ultimately, the project team’s experience with these tools made clear that a database-driven workflow was necessary to sustain efficient creation, review, and dissemination of the data.

A new system seeks to centralize the data, incorporate public linked data sources, and provide an application programing interface (API) for queries. The data includes references to many people whose names changed over time and in different relationships. The data also includes references to places that have undergone geo-political changes. Deduplicating and linking all these references presents an interesting challenge. This raises questions of how to properly associate the references with linked data sources. The volume of the data makes manually disambiguating and linking all the references unfeasible. In sum, the process of maintaining data on complex relationships requires careful decisions both in terms of curation as well as technical apparatus.

- The Cultural Assessment working group will present the work on community engagement in the Selection Workflow Framework, the continued development of a community around the creation and conceptualization of “inclusive metadata” practice, and highlight the developing cultural assessment speaker series.
- The Metadata Assessment working group will provide an overview of previous work completed and new work undertaken, including the Metadata Application Profile Clearinghouse, metadata assessment tools testing and review, the development of a new metadata benchmarks survey, an updated environmental scan, and our efforts to revise and improve the group’s website.
- Expanding upon the findings from the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS)-funded “Developing a Framework for Measuring Reuse of Digital Objects” project, members of the Reuse working group have submitted an IMLS National Leadership Grants for Libraries proposal to build the “Digital Content Reuse Assessment Framework Toolkit (D-CRAFT).” The Reuse working group will provide an update on the construction of D-CRAFT.

1. The AIG's proposal (if acccepted) should be given a lunchtime slot (not a breakfast). We need the full 90 minutes to brainstorm future activities and report out to the community. Last year's breakfast session was not long enough for us to do the work needed to effectively plan for the next year. 

2. The AIG's panel presentation (if accepted) should be placed on the same day as the AIG's lunch session (if accepted).

UW Libraries’ Preservation Services and Libraries’ Information Technology & Digital Strategies (ITS-DS) managed an Archivematica instance in-house for 2.5 years, but we found the aging infrastructure did not scale gracefully to meet our priority collections of complex born digital and audiovisual materials. At the same time, staff resources needed to troubleshoot and maintain the out-of-date installation became increasingly difficult to justify. The Libraries’ interest in cloud-based alternatives combined with recent privacy and security agreements between the UW and Amazon made AWS a compliant and attractive computing solution. Artefactual’s experience with other cloud-based services encouraged us to leverage their Archivematica knowledge to help us more sustainably improve our infrastructure and workflows. Given that funding beyond our one-year service contract is not guaranteed, one overriding project goal is building shared (and shareable) expertise between partners and beyond.

As an ongoing project, this talk will be a work-in-progress report. I will include lessons learned so far, and hope to engage with a community of practitioners about the benefits and challenges of this approach. Not just about software and infrastructure, I also hope to highlight the socio-technical aspects of such a collaboration, including cross- and intra-institutional project management and communication, and the complexities of navigating an ambitious project while maintaining daily work.

","This workshop will teach participants how to build front-end ‘skins’ for CONTENTdm powered digital collections using CollectionBuilder, a static web application that uses Jekyll, APIs, and structured metadata to improve the browsing, search, design, and visualization capacities for digital collections.","Technology Needed:

Laptop, Internet Connection

Proficiency Level:

Beginner to Advanced (with avenues for all levels of learning)

Learning Outcomes:

Participants will learn how to build digital exhibit ‘skins’ for CONTENTdm powered digital collections using the University of Idaho’s CollectionBuilder application together with sustainable strategies for implementing and maintaining CollectionBuilder at their own institutions. In doing so, they will be introduced to static web technologies, Git/GitHub, metadata best practices, data transformation techniques, and Bootstrap 4.

Description:

Last year at DLF, we detailed how our Jekyll-enabled, metadata-powered application CollectionBuilder can be used to teach about and build digital collections without highly specialized IT systems or expertise. In this workshop, we will demonstrate how we are using a version of CollectionBuilder to create digital exhibit ‘skins’—interfaces that allow users to engage with digital collection content from multiple auto-generated vantage points, such as timelines, maps, and subject clouds—as a front end for digital collections currently stored in our CONTENTdm database. By extracting our collections’ metadata from CONTENTdm and using CONTENTdm’s built-in APIs, our open-source, sustainable platform generates better browsing, display, and search features for our users while providing clear context for the collection.

In this workshop, we will teach you how to create similar ‘skins’ for your own CONTENTdm-powered digital collections. Minimal technical expertise will be required to build these and to maintain them afterwards. Participants will be broadly introduced to an array of powerful technologies and ideas, including: static web technologies (Jekyll specifically), Git, GitHub & GitHub Pages; CONTENTdm (and other) APIs; metadata standards; and Bootstrap 4. BUT the only technological knowledge you’ll need to create beautiful skins is an ability to work with text files and spreadsheets, and the only tools: a laptop, an internet connection, and metadata from a CONTENTdm collection.

We specifically created CollectionBuilder to be accessible to librarians of all skill and experience levels so that the tool might leverage librarians’ skills at creating and maintaining properly structured metadata to power the discoverability of digital collections.

In this workshop, we will walk participants through the steps of setting up the application as a skin for their own collections, paying special attention to creating the right working environments for their laptops so that they might continue their work afterwards. After setting up these environments, we will work with individuals to transform their metadata into unique digital exhibits of their own, featuring their item urls and file content. Finally, we will help participants to envision and/or develop a roadmap for implementing CollectionBuilder at a larger scale by 1) detailing the structure and workflows that we developed for transforming our current collections into their new versions and 2) discussing how to present the technology to others in such a way that other staff and librarians at your library can be empowered to use and experiment with the tool. We’ll end by outlining our future plans for the design and development of CollectionBuilder and providing avenues for contacting us after the forum for troubleshooting or other needs when using the tool.

Digitization began in January 2018.

The challenge to create a digitization capture and post-processing solution that is both high quality yet straightforward and uncomplicated for an inexperienced team was formidable. The team has been trained by an expert on the most critical imaging skills in order to achieve maximum quality and production results in a very short time. Developing metadata for the digital collection is a challenge, too, because metadata must include fields like prisoner number, confessions, place of arrest, date of execution, place of birth, gender, etc. To say that metadata is politically sensitive is an understatement!

Upon conclusion of digitization, the Archives will be accessible via the World Wide Web using Greenstone, an open source digital library software developed at the University of Waikato (Hamilton, New Zealand) and endorsed by UNESCO.

Unlocking this record is essential for cultural heritage organizations to make digitized collections broadly available for reuse. This presentation focuses on NYPL's efforts to make this data open and searchable.","The United States Copyright Office has the most complete collection of copyright records of ownership in the world, comprised of some 70 million records dating from 1870 through 1977. These documents record a large part of the literary, artistic and scientific production of the US and foreign countries. One set of these records, the Catalog of Copyright Entries (CCE), is the published index of the records that are critical to understanding the copyright status and ownership of copyrighted works. Spread over 450,000 pages, the CCE is divided by dates and classes of works, such as books, music, drama, and maps.

Although the CCE has been photographed and is publicly accessible online, using the digital records is cumbersome. No search function exists to reliably search the entire corpus of records; instead, users rely on analog techniques by opening multiple digitized volumes and paging through to find the work they are researching. In order to realize the potential impact of the records for digitizers and researchers, NYPL is building an accessible dataset of the information held in our nation's copyright record. By converting these records into machine-readable text, cultural heritage organizations can use the data to unlock access to hundreds of thousands of items. This advances knowledge by giving users the raw materials of the public domain to create new information, aesthetics, insights, and understandings.

Beginners welcome and encouraged.","Metadata assessment for large-scale digital collections involves wrangling data sets that can be very large, messy, and complicated to work with. This 55-minute workshop will provide a brief, practical, and low-pressure introduction to a few of the useful tools in Python’s pandas data analysis library for taming unruly collections metadata.

Hands-on practice exercises will be demonstrated by the instructor, and participants will be provided with simple scripts that we will run on example data sets to learn how these tools work. We will work through scenarios together to demonstrate problem-solving, and will discuss applying these tools to common use cases for the large and messy data sets that are inevitable in managing and assessing digital collections.

No prior Python experience or skills is required, because we will be working with the simple provided scripts, and will focus on a small set of easy-to-use pandas tools. Beginners are welcome and encouraged! The purpose of the workshop is for everyone to have a chance to try out some tools on actual data, and to learn about the wide array of excellent resources, tutorials, and documentation available for further learning about using pandas.

Technical requirements: Participants will need to run Python on their own computer (Mac, Linux, or Windows). If you do not yet have Python, you'll need administrative privileges to install software during the workshop; in-advance online instructions will be available.

Learning outcomes for participants: How to install and run pandas for analyzing, filtering, merging, and reshaping datasets across various formats.","Metadata assessment for large-scale digital collections involves wrangling data sets that can be very large, messy, and complicated to work with.

This presentation will give an overview of the Removable Media in Legacy Collections project at the Bentley. In the first year, over 4500 untransferred removable media from 243 processed collections were identified in a survey conducted by the presenter. The project is now in the phase of transferring digital content off of media, processing it, describing it, and ensuring that content is stored in a digital repository.

Attendees will learn about the specific challenges associated with this large-scale digital preservation project. The presenter will explain individual decisions that were made in a holistic effort to enhance the Bentley’s larger digital preservation workflow and tools to begin the project. The presenter will also describe how the project opened conversations with different archivists and teams at the Bentley and other institutions to solve socio-technical challenges arising from retroactive labor.

This presentation will include lessons learned during the first year of the project.

","Librarians in the Digital Projects Unit at the University of North Texas went through several methods of calculating their digitization lab’s capacity, eventually landing on an adapted version of the Points Process System developed by the University of Northwestern.","Over the last few years, librarians in the Digital Projects Unit (DPU) at the University of North Texas (UNT) have worked through the problem of measuring their digitization lab’s capacity. Determining a lab’s capacity can be challenging because of the multiple people involved throughout the process and the many steps a collection has to go through to go from delivery to the lab to being a visible item in a digital repository. But despite the complexity in calculating capacity, it is invaluable information for a lab to have as it ensures that the lab is not committed to more digitization projects than it can handle or, conversely, that it is not committed to fewer projects than it could have actually completed. DPU staff have attempted a number of methods to measure and calculate their lab’s capacity. They began by timing and calculating averages for individual machines and processing steps, and then tried replicating the Points Process system developed by Northwestern University and presented at the 2016 Digital Library Federation Forum in Milwaukee, WI. Now the librarians responsible for the imaging in the DPU have settled on an adapted version of the Northwestern Points Process system to fit their particular staffing configuration and workflow processes. This new capacity number has enabled the librarians to better communicate with stakeholders who bring projects into the lab for digitization to ensure that the lab stays within its capacity.

","Over the last few years, librarians in the Digital Projects Unit (DPU) at the University of North Texas (UNT) have worked through the problem of measuring their digitization lab’s capacity. Determining a lab’s capacity can be challenging because of the multiple people involved throughout the process and the many steps a collection has to go through to go from delivery to the lab to being a visible item in a digital repository.

During this workshop, participants will familiarize themselves with competencies at the intersection of scholarly communication and information literacy, then work in small groups to design learning experiences for different kinds of course-based digital publishing projects. We define digital publishing expansively to include any activity that renders scholarly or creative expression public in a digital medium, though we will focus on web media, in particular.

The audience for this workshop is both functional specialists (e.g. digital scholarship or digital collections librarians) and subject specialists (e.g. liaison librarians for English or engineering). We hope to empower digital library practitioners to see themselves as teachers, and to equip teaching librarians to engage students in how digital library technologies shape our knowledge infrastructure.

Learning outcomes for participants include:

• Connecting competencies used in digital library and scholarly communication work with knowledge practices and dispositions articulated by the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education.

• Creating a lesson plan for a course-based digital publishing project using Wiggins and McTighe’s backwards design model: (1) identify desired results, (2) determine acceptable evidence, and (3) plan learning experiences and instruction.

During the first half of the workshop, facilitators will provide a brief overview of the Framework. The bulk of the time, however, will be given over to brainstorming and discussion in small groups of publishing literacies as they relate to the Framework. These may include understanding the audience and purpose of a publishing project, identifying collaborative roles and editorial workflows, and thinking through copyright associated with the published work. Additionally, we’ll draw participants’ attention to ethical issues of digital publishing—from privacy and accessibility, to credit for contributions and social justice dimensions of open access.

During the second half of the workshop, facilitators will provide a brief overview of the backwards design model. Then participants will break into small groups to develop a lesson plan around a scenario for a course-based digital publishing project. Possible scenarios include lightweight digital editions of primary sources, anthologies of student essays, student work deposited in an institutional repository, digital exhibitions, Twitter bots, podcasts, annotations...or others! Facilitators will present the scenario, including tools or platforms being considered for use in the project, then participants will work together to create a lesson plan for that scenario. The purpose of this activity is not to attain technological fluency with a particular tool or platform, but rather to gain enough understanding of its affordances and constraints to design learning experiences around its use.

Leaders of the DLF Digital Library Pedagogy Working Group (also known as #DLFteach) will facilitate this workshop. Over the past year we have undertaken two digital publishing projects, the #DLFteach cookbook and a blog series on the ethics of multimodal scholarship and pedagogy. This workshop offers us the opportunity to share our experience with publishing processes and apply this knowledge to teaching practice.","Not only are academic libraries engaging in digital publishing initiatives on their campuses, but library workers are also engaging in the pedagogy of digital publishing with faculty and students.

The network was in distress in late 2018, when the original nodes were summoned to strategize about DPN’s future. Too late for any strategy to save the network, the nodes banded together to plan for the shutdown and find ways to support the members who had put their trust in DPN. The four nodes, including the HathiTrust replication node, supported member content stored in their systems beyond DPN’s sunset and collaborated to put forth a united front in their messaging.

DPN’s demise and its aftermath was evidence of the value of a foundational concept: distributed digital preservation distributes risk, rather than aggregating/centralizing it. Risk can be further managed by an almost organic self-healing capability across organizations if we conscientiously prepare for the possibility of the failure of one. To do something like this requires a varied group of preservation entities to build trusting relationships with each other that can be tapped when a failure occurs. The Digital Preservation Services Collaborative, which includes all of the former DPN nodes as well as other non-profit services, had done just that, united by the shared mission of helping ensure that valuable digital content is continuously preserved, even if one of our organizations cannot continue. Each of the former DPN nodes acted with continuity of preservation as its prime directive, and all cooperated with each other to ensure that no content that a depositor valued was lost. We made sure that the DPN depositors had time to determine what they wished to do, and we backed each other up even if our own node-specific depositors weren’t at risk, and even if no one was paying us to hold onto the content for a time. Each of the nodes needed to independently determine the desires of their own depositors regarding their DPN content and ensure that the total sum of DPN content was held until we could be confident that it was no longer needed. The good will and shared commitment evident in these actions was remarkable.

DPN’s birth brought these separate entities together into regular conversation and collaborative relationships, and DPN’s demise showed that its former nodes’ willingness to act together in mutual pursuit of our higher, shared goals without DPN holding us together may have been its greatest accomplishment for digital preservation. This talk will discuss the events leading to the shutdown of DPN, the nodes’ response, each nodes’ strategy to manage the transition, and the resulting outcomes.

The American Center of Oriental Research (ACOR) in Jordan is leveraging digital tools to transform its photographic archive into digital objects accessible online for re-use by anyone, combatting restrictions to records from the colonial era. ACOR’s research library and archives has digitized 17,000 images, which are shared with descriptive metadata through an open-access platform. This digital archive has been made possible through self-reflective collaboration. Project Archivists with access to Digital Humanities and MLIS training have worked together with Jordanian-Palestinian librarians and digitization officers to produce best practices fit for context. This collaboration matters because decisions taken at the metadata level inform how digital objects are presented to - and therefore understood by - local and international communities. In the postcolonial context of overseas research centers, this is a significant responsibility. Due to the flat structure of the metadata shared alongside digital images, ACOR is able to present Arabic-language publications and international publications instantaneously. Giving equal weight to locally produced knowledge and knowledge produced abroad is unusual in a digital humanities landscape dominated by the English-language in general, and an academic climate with an endemic privileging of Euro-American scholarship in specific. Lessons learnt through this three-year process are applicable to other social contexts, and this presentation will share solutions that can be implemented where there is a desire to engage previously-excluded communities in the process of archival curation and communication.","Digital Humanities in the Arab region is an emerging field facing inherited problems.

This presentation will share our obstacles from the first year of implementation and how the staff at UTRGV has overcome these challenges, as well as the lessons learned throughout this process. Among the difficulties faced during the first year of digital preservation was a massive data loss at the SC&UA (approximately 1 TB), negotiations with IT (both at the university level and the library level), and a staff change over. These obstacles often were coupled with critical junctures of our work, placing the digital preservation program in uncharted waters.

The presentation will focus on the key challenges involved in delivering our Suffrage 2018 programme, including setting objectives, designing measures of success, planning, funding, problem solving, audience and partner engagement, and staff skills development. It will not describe in detail the programme itself or go into technical detail. Instead, it will use the programme to give examples to illustrate the key challenges addressed and to prompt discussion of how such challenges can be overcome.

Libraries can help mitigate these issues by becoming involved early on, providing planning templates, and providing technical advising.

Virginia Tech University Libraries (VTUL) is partnered with the English Department to evolve a digital archive, Lord Byron and His Times, into a prosopography project by updating the technology, migrating the content, and developing a interactive site built on a new information architecture that allows users to fully exploit the benefits of machine-readable data files. VTUL resources provided in time, personnel, technology, and storage make the sustainability of the project vital, but currently there is no policy or procedure for transferring the responsibility of the project to VTUL, or for preserving complex, dynamic projects like this.

Accordingly, a major component of this prosopography project is to incorporate digital preservation and data management planning early on. With our diverse team of advisors, we are implementing a plan based on a preservation profile and a data management plan during the development phase of the project rather than after completion.

The goal of this presentation is to review this project as a case study and discuss it as a strategy for preserving DH projects effectively through project management, early documentation, and policy development.","When Digital Humanities (DH) projects come to completion they often face the issue of sustainability, both technically and organizationally.

Last year we had the opportunity to sit on a panel with three other universities’ preservation personnel and discuss our experiences in collaborating with IT to build sustainable preservation systems. Since DigiPres2018, Virginia Tech University Libraries’ (VTUL) preservation team has moved into the ITS Division and began integrating workflows and resources.

This ongoing transition has not been without its challenges. Translation between digital preservation vocabulary (OAIS, ISO-16363) and IT vocabulary (ITIL, Agile); learning to use the JIRA project management and reporting system; and discussion over what elements are included in the preservation system have continuously caused small setbacks. Delineating new responsibilities and reevaluating the combined team’s dynamic has also been a necessary but slow stage in this transition.

However, the gradual successes have increased efficiency and decision-making as we evolve. First, increasing IT personnel overall has evenly distributed work and enabled more focus on certain projects. Second, IT and digital preservation personnel are also both intentionally including the other in meetings, projects, and most importantly, in advice from all stakeholders.

The goal of this presentation is to outline the process we are using to join forces and integrate IT and digital preservation, focusing on project prioritization and management, communication strategies, and joining forces to develop and implement a digital preservation infrastructure. This presentation will include both preservation and IT personnel at VTUL in order to provide a balanced and unique perspective on workflow integration.","Digital preservation relies on a combined knowledge of archival practices and technical expertise.

Participants will work together in creating practical getting-started implementation plans for ethical engagement with technologies of surveillance.,"Many of today’s library technologies operate as vehicles of surveillance, often without the fully informed consent of librarians or library users. These systems and technologies are designed to track and correlate user behavior. This user data is then applied for the purposes of delivering a better user experience, but it can also be used to build profiles of users with the intent of marketing products or reselling data to third-parties. The DLF Technologies of Surveilling (ToS) Working Group critically examines our relationships with data collection technologies. This group interrogates the methods and ethical implications of these technologies and seeks to establish guidelines for how to operationalize interrogation of technology, wherever we encounter it in our profession. The focus of this workshop will be hands-on learning and feedback activities based around the focus areas of the ToS Working Group: vendor-based systems, library-built systems, professional ethics, advocacy, outreach, and instruction.

In this session, members of the ToS Working Group will provide an update on the materials produced by the group over the previous year, inviting participants to engage with new documents, case studies, tools, workflows, and concepts that help support ethical engagement with today’s technologies of surveillance.

For example, we will facilitate scenario exercises based on commonly-encountered challenges to privacy and surveillance in libraries. These scenarios might cover the following topics:

— Your university provost is moving forward with an initiative involving predictive analytics and student intervention. The library is being asked to install video cameras in public spaces and contribute data towards a facial recognition and machine learning database. How can you effectively express concerns related to this project?

— A graduate student keeps receiving statements for loans that they haven’t requested. It turns out that someone has stolen his social security number and opened up several loans in their name. What do you recommend?

— An undergraduate activist wants to coordinate a Black Lives Matter protest on campus, but doesn’t want police or administration to figure out the details in advance. What do you recommend?

— A federal agency contacts your circulation department requesting records for an undocumented undergraduate student. How does the library respond?

— A psychology professor on campus is conducting research on social media and prison populations. She wants to keep her browsing private and also wants to communicate confidentially with subjects. What do you recommend?

Workshop participants will work together through these scenarios, using the DLF ToS materials to provide a practical path forward that they can apply within the context of their home institutions.

Workshop participants will learn how to:

1. Describe the role, purpose, and involvement opportunities of the DLF Technologies of Surveillance Working Group

Digital Paxton (digitalpaxton.org), a digital collection and scholarly edition devoted to Pennsylvania’s first major pamphlet war, begins to answer this challenge. Alongside a wealth of printed materials—pamphlets, newsprint, books, broadsides, and political cartoons—we’ve digitized hundreds of diaries, letters, and treaty minutes, which unsettle the singular authority of those colonial records.

But what if we could imagine a perspective on the Paxton massacre that, given the genocide of the Susquehannock, could not be retrieved?

That graphic novel will be written, illustrated, and published by Native American artists: Dr. Lee Francis (Laguna Pueblo) will write the script; Weshoyot Alvitre (Tongva) will pencil, ink, and color pages; and Native Realities Press will publish and distribute the graphic novel to all 573 federally-recognized tribes. In my 18-minute presentation I propose to discuss the collaborative development process, the values that animate the project, and the means by which we will make the graphic novel accessible in print and as a standalone, interactive digital project.

Digital Paxton (digitalpaxton.org), a digital collection and scholarly edition devoted to Pennsylvania’s first major pamphlet war, begins to answer this challenge. Alongside a wealth of printed materials—pamphlets, newsprint, books, broadsides, and political cartoons—we’ve digitized hundreds of diaries, letters, and treaty minutes, which unsettle the singular authority of those colonial records.

State of the art software systems, like CCS’ docWorks, does not only provide automated digitization as such, but is focusing also on supporting the complete workflow, which is usually split between project partners specialized in Document ingest, like E, or human corrections, like D.

The next step in increasing efficiency in this process chain is to move the entire processing infrastructure into the cloud. Currently, dedicated IT infrastructure is typically mainly because of the large data volumes to move. While processing power and storage is offered at competitive pricing and with very high flexibility, the fast and cost-efficient transport of terabytes of data over internet connections is still an open issue.

In a joint project between CCS, E and D a large-scale project of C newspaper digitization is used to evaluate the feasibility of a fully cloud based workflow. While the project is still in an early stage today, we expect results to be available in September 2019. In the course of the presentation we will share the technical setup chosen with the community, present data on reliability, scalability and throughput of the system used. Further, an analysis of the cost of data movement in and out of the cloud will be presented

Libraries. The group has members from many divisions of the library including Application Development, Cataloging, Digital Collections, Institutional Repository and Digital Conversion. These staff members have come together to administer Hyacinth, Columbia’s metadata and content management application.

After several formative meetings, the group has begun to show its ability to collaboratively make shared use of the metadata application more effective and efficient. This presentation will focus on two case studies that show the value such an administrative group can bring to the shared use of software - implementing relatedness statements and managing controlled vocabularies. In the case of relatedness statements, the group navigated the varied expressions of relatedness required by different library divisions avoiding collisions and blocks to future development. Shared management of controlled vocabularies has required the group to produce robust documentation and develop clear user permissions to prevent alteration of terms as well as a remediation process for safely removing erroneous terms from the system and records.

In the pursuit of these projects, we have seen the vital need for software developers and metadata practitioners to work together. Each has a unique perspective of the problems at hand. The developers have created a powerful tool to organize and publish metadata to numerous websites and digital collections.

Stacey Berry will discuss how transcription is being used as a source of interdisciplinary undergraduate research and as a site of community engagement in her project Honoring the Dead: A Digital Archive of the Insane Indian Asylum and in her work with the university archives. She will focus on the power of transcription as a way to right the historical record though access and interaction with archival documents.

Vaughan Hennen will talk about his approach to DH through collaboration and teaching. He applied critical library pedagogy as a theory of transcription in Dr. Berry’s Digital Collection and Curation course, teaching students how to use transcription to read and study the novel, Frankenstein. He will illustrate transcription power to disrupt and dismantle dominant discourses through feminist pedagogy and critical librarianship.

Dr. Berry and Mr. Hennen collaborated through the lens of transcription. It will be through this lens, that they will host a workshop where participants will learn, discuss, and examine the praxis of transcription. The learning objectives of this workshop include new perspectives on transcription, the undergraduate tangibility of DH, the various implications of transcription, and theories of transcription.

In this session, the presenters will lead audience members in discussions to develop strategies and takeaways. A zine will be given to each attendee to help guide them through the workshop and will have a section for notes and creative takeaways.

This presentation shares project results to-date and prompts a conversation on strategies for curating open and accessible resources for digital scholarship.","In recent years, archaeologists have increasingly utilized digital technologies for fieldwork, as well as in laboratory and classroom settings. This adoption of digital tools is guided in part by the ability of such tools to contribute new insights into archaeological datasets and ensure long-term preservation of data, but it also relates to the pedagogical opportunities afforded by easy-to-use platforms for digital mapping or web publishing. The Digital Archaeology Toolkit project (https://osf.io/v54zd/) aims to curate a crowd-sourced list of digital tools and learning resources. Built atop these resources, the project will curate multiple ""deployable"" digital toolkits to address specific research problems and workflows common to archaeology and other social sciences. The toolkits, published openly online, can be customized by practitioners and tailored to specific project needs.

This presentation offers an opportunity to share the results of the initial crowd-sourcing phase of the project and to solicit feedback on the second phase of the project -- curating a series of toolkits -- from a diverse audience of librarians, technologists, and researchers in disciplines beyond archaeology. We are especially interested in learning about challenges related to infrastructure, user design, and project sustainability that others have faced in creating and deploying similar digital resources. Our presentation will briefly introduce a prototype toolkit and address issues we have already faced related to resource crowd-sourcing and metadata. By reserving 10 minutes for discussion, we hope to prompt a conversation on strategies for curating open and accessible resources for digital scholarship.","In recent years, archaeologists have increasingly utilized digital technologies for fieldwork, as well as in laboratory and classroom settings.

Our universities, however, should not sacrifice privacy rights and self-autonomy to maintain the status quo. Instead, we must provide students with the tools to write their own identities apart from the influence of corporations. This presentation will discuss incorporating surveillance themes into diverse humanities curricula, outlining in detail how to develop engaging lessons on privacy policies.

Recently, I led an activity on this topic. I began by asking students “Do you read privacy policies?” and “Why do privacy policies matter?” to determine their engagement with corporate terms of service. Following this brief discussion, students were asked to develop a perfect privacy policy in small groups. To spark ideas and conversation, they received copies of current corporate privacy policies. Ranging from Spotify to Lime to Tinder, these policies were drawn from companies students trust and rely upon. Students then presented to the class, describing elements of their policy and how their creation differed from corporate offerings. The class selected the ‘best’ of the privacy policies presented and wrote reflections on this experience.

This lesson demonstrates how surveillance pedagogies can be incorporated into a variety of classes, intervening with the invisible networks underlying our digital lives. Attendees will walk away with a step-by-step guide on this lesson as well as other strategies for implementing surveillance education in their own instruction.

The Japanese Diaspora Initiative aims to make the Hoover Institution Library & Archives (HILA) a leading center for archive-based research and analysis of historical issues regarding Japan in areas of interest to the institution: war, revolution, and peace. Funded by an anonymous $9 million gift the initiative has begun by focusing on Japan’s modern diaspora, with particular attention to both Japanese Americans and other overseas Japanese communities, especially during the rise and fall of the Empire of Japan. The initiative includes collection development, curatorial work, scholarship, digitization, indexing for search, and free access to more than half a million pages of rare Japanese newspapers (Hoji Shinbun) published in the Americas and Hawaii from the late nineteenth century through the present day. HILA has an agreement with East View Information Services, which partners with Digital Divide Data to digitize original newspapers and microfilm from the Stanford University newspapers collection as well as other libraries’ collections. The newspapers are both English and Japanese. Some newspapers are handwritten and printed in lithograph; most newspapers are typeset. The newspaper images are created from 35mm negative microfilm, original newspaper, and born-digital files. The newspapers are digitized with technical specifications in line with the Library of Congress’s National Digital Newspaper Program. EVIS and HILA host the output data on the Veridian software platform. This talk will describe the digital collection and the difficulties encountered in digitizing Japanese-English bilingual newspapers.

Although we faced challenges and overcame roadblocks at every stage of the project, this presentation will focus on the final 14 months of the extended grant period, during which we realized our repository required significant modifications to scale up, we planned for and accomplished that work with the buy-in of our consortial partners, and we completed the ingest using innovative, scalable workflows (and a borrowed supercomputer).

A cornerstone to our success was re-using aggregate archival and serial metadata in Islandora that originated in ArchivesSpace or our ILS, synching metadata and identifiers between systems.

Over the past year, I’ve been experimenting with ways to leverage records management theory and techniques to develop a support service for faculty trying to regain intellectual control over their digital image research collections, and I’ve had some exciting successes.

In this presentation, I’ll be discussing three organization and aggregation strategies, how Adobe Bridge can support the implementation of these strategies, and conclude with ways to build up a service offering based on these strategies. Firstly, I’ll discuss using semantic hierarchical organization structures to help encode information about the images into their organizational context. This gives the researcher the ability to perform top down thematic searching in their collections. Secondly, I’ll discuss developing a natural language controlled vocabulary that is meaningful to the researcher, and embedding these keywords into the item’s operating system metadata. This facilitates using a computer’s native search feature to call and aggregate images based on these keywords. Thirdly, I’ll discuss developing and applying a descriptive naming convention that allows the researcher to embed important provenance data into the name of the file, protecting the image’s connection to its source and citation information. Adobe bridge has batch processing features that support all of these actions. Building this into a sustainable service is an ongoing experiment, but I’ll share my progress so far and the approaches I’ve been taking.","Digital image collections can be difficult bodies of research data to work with because computers cannot “read” their contents.

In addition to student and faculty research works, Florida Atlantic University (FAU) Digital Library is home to a variety of resources ranging from rare primary materials to local historical collections. Just as important as it is to bring far away people together, cultivating one’s own campus relationships with faculty and students is equally relevant and valuable. This presentation will highlight three collections from the FAU Research Repository to illustrate the results of building and sustaining librarian-faculty partnerships to advance student engagement, research and learning. Repository collections such as the FAU Undergraduate Research Journal, Three Minute Thesis winning presentations, and student research posters are paths to building librarian-faculty-student relationships to advance future collaborations.

The conversations highlighted the needs for a digital content strategy, development of digital collections policies, effective digital preservation procedures, and a revisioning of the anticipated repository migrations. These also brought voices to the table that had previously not been included, which resulted in a rich and meaningful approach to these discussions. Additionally, there was growing concern that the migration may not be as appropriate as it was originally assumed to be, due to repository development needs, metadata loss, and user access needs.

From this, a task force was formed by the Dean to develop a report of the responsibilities and workflows around the digital content and repositories. This resulted in a more than 30-page report with an in-depth appraisal of the digital collections and their sustainability, assessments of digital preservation and metadata, and several needs that were identified for moving forward.

This presentation will share the assessments performed as part of this process and what areas of need were identified for the digital repositories to be a success at the University of Cincinnati Libraries.

When the IR began it was not intrinsically clear if it and the Archives would be closely collaborative; the collecting scope was not articulated, and filling the repository became a priority with little coordination regarding overlap or connections between materials in both units. These units are now developing workflows, outreach efforts, coherent messaging, and even a joint collection development policy in order to ensure a seamless experience for patrons and a systematic approach to preservation strategies within the library. For materials ranging from dissertations to unpublished research data and recordings of special events on campus, our two distinct units of the library are forging a collaboration with the intention of increasing deposits and making the most of our limited resources for digital space and software.

This partnership also helps our units address current infrastructure limitations, particularly for the Archives in being able to provide unmediated access to born digital items. Additionally, discussions of future platform licenses for either unit now include both Archives and IR so that any changes strategically acknowledge the role that both units have in the curation and preservation of material produced across campus.

2. documenting learning in ways that link to outcomes and impacts for all learners

3. implementing the use of new technologies in diverse settings, such as the workforce

4. interpersonal interactions and peer-to-peer learning

5. learning that lies at the intersection of people, the learning environment, and new technologies.

Built on the Omeka platform and funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the project is a collaboration of the Latino Migration Project, the Southern Oral History Program, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Libraries. There were two major considerations in developing the site: first, since Spanish speaking researchers and the Latino community in NC were important audiences, it was crucial to create a bilingual site. Secondly, to avoid the tedium and potential errors of duplicate data entry, we needed to sync data from our authoritative source (CONTENTdm) to Omeka.

To create a bilingual site, we forked the Omeka Multilanguage plugin and customized it heavily. Our solution also depends on a custom theme, a metadata schema with English and Spanish translations of most fields, and English and Spanish translations of Omeka “SimplePages.” s.

The project is designed to foster healing by providing a forum for community members to share their memories, while preserving a record for future study.","During the month of November, 2018, both Pepperdine University and the surrounding community of Malibu, California experienced two collective traumas in quick succession. Late in the evening of November 7th, a gunman opened fire on the weekly College Night at the Borderline Bar and Grill - a popular local music venue - killing 13 people including one Pepperdine student. Less than 24 hours later, just as the community was beginning to grieve this loss, a devastating wildfire spread through the area. Pepperdine follows a shelter-in-place protocol during Malibu’s periodic wildfires, and the campus is designed to safely facilitate this strategy. As the campus was surrounded by fire on three sides, thousands of Pepperdine students sheltered in the library watching through the picture windows as a wall of flames swept towards them. By the time it was contained nearly two weeks later, the fast-moving Woolsey Fire had burned 96,949 acres of land, destroyed 1,643 structures, and forced nearly 300,000 people to evacuate.

In the aftermath of these traumatic events, Pepperdine Libraries launched the Woolsey Fire Memory Project. Inspired by community archives that have sprung up in the wake of other collective traumas such as Hurricane Katrina and the Boston Marathon bombing, WFMP is collecting the photographs, videos, writing, and oral histories of both Pepperdine and Malibu community members, and harnessing Archive-It to capture the online response to these events. In addition to fostering healing by providing a forum for sharing memories, the project will culminate in a contextualized online exhibit.

Presenters from Yale University Library, University of Notre Dame, and University of California, San Diego will address discussion questions that surface their experience thus far regarding organizational advocacy and capacity building for software preservation and emulation; establishing trust and expectations among members of the EaaSI network; measuring baseline costs; and EaaSI software development, beta deployment and testing.

Discussion Questions:

What motivates your organization’s participation in the EaaSI Network? What did you view as the greatest potential barrier to participation?

Could each panelist describe their experience with the capacity-building exercises? Who participated in your organization?

What have you learned about your organization and the impact of software curation on your policies and workflows?

Discuss the technical implementation for EaaSI - how are you imagining EaaSI’s role in your broader service infrastructure? How do you imagine delivering these services to users - who are those users?

It articulates how human-friendly file names make images more findable and offer suggestions to practitioners.,"The concept of an online digital image repository began almost 25 years ago. Since then, libraries, archives, museums, galleries, and other cultural heritage institutions have created digital image repositories to highlight and share their unique materials. As these image repositories have evolved, practitioners have attempted to assess who uses images and for what purposes in order to make collection development decisions and user interface improvements. Professional literature documents the difficulties practitioners face when attempting to do this type of assessment. No single tool provides digital image repository administrators with detailed image reuse information. While exploring the usefulness of Reverse Image Lookup (RIL, Google Image Search) and EXIF-metadata extraction as assessment tools, I observed intriguing user file naming behavior that showed promise for tracing reuse using RIL. I hypothesize that this intentional user file naming yields results that make it possible to identify the use and reuse of digital objects. Furthermore, by using conventions employed by the users may make repository images more discoverable.

Results from the research study will present findings on how digital image file names influence Google Image Search results.

Our training on the Open Journals System (OJS) software that powers our digital journals was offered to librarians through Columbia Libraries’ ‘Developing Librarian’ program. Through this initiative, the Digital Scholarship division gives technical training in coding and software applications to subject librarians, providing professional development opportunities for liaisons as well as insight into the tools and services that Digital Scholarship might be able to offer their constituencies. The Developing Librarian training also integrated aspects of the Digital Publishing Workshop program, emphasizing publication ethics and debates in scholarly communications through the lens of the publishing cycle.

Conversations with subject librarians also helped to create a framework for the liaison librarian on each journal that would expand our capacity to closely oversee editorial practice and offer technological support to students at a time when education and active learning have become integral to publishing services in our Libraries.

Build the right thing - check …

Build the thing right - check.

But no one can use the thing you build … until you release it.

For over a year, Harvard Library has had a live prototype of a Blacklight application that allows for search and discovery of over 6 million, publicly available, digital objects from the Harvard Library Digital Repository Service (DRS). These objects have all been accessible via links in Harvard’s catalog and archival finding aids, but with tens of millions of records, for scholars attempting to use these digital objects, the process can feel like finding a needle in a haystack.

Years of user research tells us that all scholars, from the most sophisticated faculty researcher to the novice K-12 student, expect to interact with digital content through a single, streamlined search and to find digitized content with all related metadata in one space. But with millions of objects to share and dozens of other systems to support, scalability and sustainability make moving from prototype to v1.0 a long and winding road, even when we know what users want.

Through a timeboxed workcycle approach and integrated, cross functional teams, and testing with actual users in real-time, Harvard Digital Collections will make it out of the prototype phase to Alpha, Beta, and v1 releases in just 16 weeks. Come learn from content strategy, design, and development experts about our journey through this process, and how we utilize rapid prototype testing, sandbox environments, near-continuous releases, and high-performance team protocols to set our innovation to scale and sustain without fear.

Participants will be introduced to the Project Management Toolkit and the variety of resources to support their projects. “Part 2: Tools” will build on the foundation and focus on teaching technologies in the Toolkit through case studies. Participants will begin by managing one project and progress to a portfolio. Attendees may elect to attend one or both workshops in the day, depending on their knowledge of project management and goals for learning.

In the first section of the “Part 1: Foundations” workshop, members of the DLF Project Managers Group Steering committee will teach workshop participants about various project management theories and how they apply to managing digital projects in a library environment. While the waterfall method, moving from task to task or milestone to milestone in a project, completing each stage before moving to the next, is commonly employed in digital projects, libraries’ project managers are borrowing strategies from IT development and employing agile project management techniques for digital projects. Agile project management provides an advantage in its iterative approach, where different portions of the project can be in multiple stages, concurrently. Workshop leaders will discuss how they employ these strategies separately or in combination to build successful workflows. Facilitators will also discuss project charters and project plans, and how they’ve implemented these documents to guide project work.

Participants will be introduced to resources available in the Project Managers Toolkit in the second section, “Part 2: Tools”. They will use case studies and the templates section of the Toolkit to create a project charter, plan, and timeline for their assigned sample project. Participants will discuss in breakout groups their methodologies for implementing the project templates and why they selected to use the templates they did.

The workshop will conclude with a discussion on how to implement project management at their institution, addressing work culture, resource allocation, communication, staff experience, and other constraints.

It would be highly beneficial for participants in this workshop to bring their own laptops so they can follow along and use the Toolkit. The room will need to be supplied with power strips for the attendees.
