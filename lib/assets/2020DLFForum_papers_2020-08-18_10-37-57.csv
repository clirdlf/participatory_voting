We’ve aggregated documentation for 200+ digital collections into a central, shared repository. We’ll share how we did this, what we’re documenting, who has access, and why it was important to collaborate with internal and external stakeholders.","Institutional knowledge needs to be documented in a shared space, not kept in an individual’s head or location only accessible to a single person. At the University of Michigan, we’ve aggregated all of the digital documentation for about 200 digital collections into a single online environment in order to increase our shared organizational knowledge and for better, faster access to documentation needed throughout a digital collection’s lifecycle. This information is critical to our upcoming platform migration.

When a digital collection used to be created, it was enough that the collection itself was available. Over the past 3 years, we have captured the who, what, when, where, and how relating to each and every digital collection. In many cases for the older digital collections, we had misplaced or never had a lot of needed information. I’ll share how we dealt with this issue and how we changed our workflow for creating new digital collections to prevent this issue in the future.

We made decisions about the digital environment and its structure based on who, internal and external, needed to access the documentation and when during the digital collection lifecycle. I’ll share how we considered user access and controls during implementation.

This documentation work is part of the assessment of digital collections on which we presented two years ago to the DLF community. We hope to share our workflow and approach in hopes that we can collaborate with others as they consider their long-term organizational needs around documentation for any digital project.","Institutional knowledge needs to be documented in a shared space, not kept in an individual’s head or location only accessible to a single person.

","Members of PA Digital, DPLA’s hub in Pennsylvania, will take you through their process of migrating over 400,000 metadata records from over 80 institutions in legacy software to a new aggregation system, Shoofly Pie.","PA Digital, DPLA’s hub in Pennsylvania, developed its first aggregation software in 2014. Since its launch, PA Digital has expanded significantly. More than 80 institutions have contributed rich collections to PA Digital, allowing us to curate primary source sets for educators on topics such as the labor movement in the steel industry, students protest, Quakers and the abolitionist movement, and women’s suffrage. We began the project harvesting mostly from CONTENTdm, but as interest and participation grew, we adapted to harvest from systems such as Bepress, Islandora, Omeka, Samvera, and VUDL. With each new system, modifications to our software and extensive troubleshooting were required. Further, Metadata Specialists had no flexibility to transform or validate metadata, so contributors had to make adjustments locally. It became increasingly cumbersome to efficiently make Pennsylvania’s unique collections available through the DPLA. It was clear we needed a new, more sustainable system.

PA Digital’s Metadata Specialists partnered with developer staff to create personas and user stories, draft functional requirements, and explore new systems to aggregate, process, and review metadata at scale. The team looked beyond library software systems and decided on Airflow, an open-source workflow management platform. PA Digital’s implementation of Airflow calls XSLT and Schematron scripts from GitHub, stores data in AWS, indexes in SolrCloud, and pushes data onto OAI-PMH servers and into a Blacklight interface (funnelcake.padigital.org).

This presentation will give an overview of how the workflows and system, named Shoofly Pie, functions as a flexible and scalable metadata aggregator.

Due to copyright restrictions on most twentieth and twenty-first century literature, innovative approaches are increasingly necessary for advancing the collections as data movement and the scholarly fields of cultural analytics and digital scholarship.

Temple Libraries have been digitizing underrepresented works of post-WWII “New Wave” science fiction, developing a cross-departmental workflow to ingest the scans and OCR’d text into HathiTrust’s repository for preservation and curation. This process required evaluating gaps in HathiTrust’s holdings and developing a local, adaptable model of digitization, ingestion, and exhibition. The project is expanding to include collaborations with Texas A&M Libraries’ and Kansas University Libraries’ special collections in science fiction, with plans to diversify the institutions involved in the grassroots digitization effort, including non-member libraries of HathiTrust and international partners.

The HathiTrust Digital Library is a collaborative, large-scale repository of texts accumulated through the mass digitization of research library collections, and as such, reflects the traditional collecting practices of those institutions. Like many organizations, HathiTrust is reviewing its systems, operations and practices to rectify ongoing inequalities addressed by social justice movements like Black Lives Matter. As we move towards greater inclusion of underrepresented voices, materials, and genres in our digital collection through more intentional acquisition, we are exploring new, coordinated digitization and ingestion workflows that balance scale and sustainability with equity and value.","This presentation explores a collaborative digitization project between Temple University Libraries and other Special Collections with holdings in mass-market science fiction, aimed at leveraging HathiTrust Digital Library’s infrastructure for data preservation and curation.

With Miriam Posner’s call to “come up with better ways of investing in people’s long-term potential as scholars” in mind, Leigh Bonds developed a professional development program to provide disciplinary librarians opportunities to attend immersive workshops in digital scholarship. Those participating in the program could choose from workshops that provide a general overview of the digital scholarship methods and tools; a subject-specific overview of methods and tools; or intensive training on a specific method, tool, or topic. The executive team approved a pilot program (2019-20) to focus on digital humanities, funding eight librarians in the arts and humanities liaison cohorts, special collections, and area studies. During the pilot year, the minimum requirements for participants included developing at least one annual goal related to digital scholarship, joining the campus DH Slack channel, and participating in the fall University Libraries’ Digital Scholarship Forum.

Minimally, Bonds anticipated these workshops would enable librarians to identify either research projects or course assignments that could be enhanced by using a digital method/tool. At most, she thought they would prepare her colleagues to collaborate with researchers on projects, collaborate with faculty and graduate students to integrate digital scholarship instruction and projects into courses, and/or develop their own digital projects. With six participating in the pilot, the program proved transformational: each participant benefitted from having intensive workshop experiences to not only delve deeply into the method(s)/tool(s), but also develop close connections to broader networks of colleagues and practitioners. Participants attended DHSI, UPenn's DREAMLab, HILT, Princeton’s Slavic DH Summer Workshop, ARL's Digital Scholarship Institute, and the DLF Forum’s pre-conference workshops. Each successfully integrated their learning into their librarianship, and began generating new ideas around collections and discussing those ideas across the organization. On their own initiative, the first cohort formed a bi-weekly working group to support one another as they integrated DH methods into their librarianship and scholarship. Based on these successful outcomes, the Libraries’ management committee approved a two-year extension of the program, expanding it to ten participants that include librarians from the social sciences and sciences.

This panel will provide an overview of the program and its outcomes, providing conference attendees with a potential model for building capacity for DS support at their own institutions. Bonds will outline details about the program—including participant requirements and costs—and discuss the ripple effect the program has had across the organization. Three participants will then share the experiences of those from their respective areas and discuss the program’s impact on their librarianship and scholarship: Courtney Hunt will represent participants from the arts and humanities liaison cohort; Jen Schnabel, special collections; and Ann Marie Davis, area studies.

We call these workshops “Storytelling Fellows,” and in them, graduate students learn to make digital stories or podcasts in which they tell the story of their research. In these workshops, aside from learning new skills and preparing stories for varied audiences, the students also benefit from making connections with other graduate students and developing their creations in a workshop environment. Storytelling Fellows is very work driven and community based.

In response to a growing interest in TEI, or text encoding, on our campuses, we took an online professional development workshop on how to encode and create digital editions of texts with the TEI standards. The workshop that we attended was good--and it met its own goals--but after having taken it, we couldn’t help but to wonder what a TEI workshop would look like in the Storytelling Fellows design that we’ve developed and come to trust. In particular, we wanted to design a workshop that would be much more project-based, learner driven, and conducive to people making connections, not just with teachers, but also with cohort members.

In a presentation, we would give some background about the Storytelling Fellows model before laying out how we used that framework to design a fun, interactive TEI workshop. We would also be able to relate how our design worked and what revisions we look to do upon further iteration.

Then, Christina Drummond, Data Trust Program Officer with the Educopia Institute, will present a collection of ethical frameworks, processes and tools that could guide data trusts and digital libraries as they look to leverage usage analytics.

During the community watch parties, the presenters hope to facilitate a discussion of how publication usage data (not just for books) could be ethically used, or potentially abused by digital library stakeholders. Participants will also be asked to consider what principles and protections should govern such data trusts that serve the scholarly community.

Then, Christina Drummond, Data Trust Program Officer with the Educopia Institute, will present a collection of ethical frameworks, processes and tools that could guide data trusts and digital libraries as they look to leverage usage analytics.
During the community watch parties, the presenters hope to facilitate a discussion of how publication usage data (not just for books) could be ethically used, or potentially abused by digital library stakeholders. Participants will also be asked to consider what principles and protections should govern such data trusts that serve the scholarly community.
The Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative (COKI) is a leading hub for analysis and evaluation of open knowledge in higher education, leveraging more than 12 trillion data elements to inform the analysis of open knowledge practices and impact.
The Open Access eBook Usage (OAeBU) Data Trust pilot, supported by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation through December 2021, is developing infrastructure, policy, and governance solutions to support the aggregation, benchmarking, and reporting of monograph usage data from across library and commercial publishers and their publishing platforms and services.",,,"Drummond, Christina",Educopia Institute,United States of America,North_America, ,christina@educopia.org,,"christina@educopia.org, cameron.neylon@curtin.edu.au, Kevin.Hawkins@unt.edu","Drummond, Christina;

Librarians at the State Library of North Carolina initiated the development of a “multi-collection” option for CollectionBuilder’s CONTENTdm skin, which allows creators to use objects from multiple digital collections when curating a digital exhibit. At the New College of Florida (NCF), the CollectionBuilder skin was modified to interact with SobekCM Repository’s API and build explorative interfaces on top of existing collections. Additionally, the tool’s use in pedagogical settings at NCF has demonstrated CollectionBuilder’s value in teaching data management and web development concepts alongside digital collection practices.

The ingest process is coordinated with repository managers at a system-wide level. Once a representative sample of the score collection is published in eScholarship, there are plans to promote the collection via a digital display platform. This will allow us to curate a selection of the scores, provide context for the project, and integrate multimedia files. Finally, we hope to go beyond providing access to the individual scores by asking contributors for derived MusicXML files, which we hope will both enhance preservation at the file level and establish a contemporary music dataset of value to scholars and composers.

","Digital Humanities (DH) projects are complex with multiple moving components in need of preservation. Early preservation planning for each component is a strategy for long-term access. This presentation will break down various components of a DH project, preservation approaches for those components, packaging methods for future recreation/emulation.","Digital Humanities (DH) projects have multiple moving components that each require their own preservation strategy. Projects begin with some form of data (text, images, csv files), that evolves into planning documentation (grant proposals, wireframes, productions plans), which leads to the project site (HTML/CSS). It can be overwhelming planning to preserve an entire interactive website as one entity. This presentation outlines our approach to breaking down a DH project into individual components, applying a preservation method appropriate to its content type, and then packaging each component together for long-term storage.

This approach relies on emulation over migration to address format obsolescence. Since each component is a unique format, and all of the components are packaged together, file format migration would be performed manually. This is not a scalable method. By planning for emulation and reconstruction of a website, we can develop a streamlined workflow for appraising, packaging, and preserving content. For this approach to be effective, documentation for each component is critical. Documentation is a driving force behind successful emulation to capture not only the technical components and decisions, but to establish a clear understanding of the goal and purpose of the project.

This presentation is the result of a test case performed on a current DH project to export and appraise the content and supporting infrastructure, apply individual preservation methods, and reconstruct the project from those components. This aligns with the conference topic Project management as we are providing a potential workflow for producing preservation-friendly DH projects.

Projects begin with some form of data (text, images, csv files), that evolves into planning documentation (grant proposals, wireframes, productions plans), which leads to the project site (HTML/CSS). It can be overwhelming planning to preserve an entire interactive website as one entity. This presentation outlines our approach to breaking down a DH project into individual components, applying a preservation method appropriate to its content type, and then packaging each component together for long-term storage.
This approach relies on emulation over migration to address format obsolescence. Since each component is a unique format, and all of the components are packaged together, file format migration would be performed manually. This is not a scalable method. By planning for emulation and reconstruction of a website, we can develop a streamlined workflow for appraising, packaging, and preserving content. For this approach to be effective, documentation for each component is critical. Documentation is a driving force behind successful emulation to capture not only the technical components and decisions, but to establish a clear understanding of the goal and purpose of the project.
This presentation is the result of a test case performed on a current DH project to export and appraise the content and supporting infrastructure, apply individual preservation methods, and reconstruct the project from those components. This aligns with the conference topic Project management as we are providing a potential workflow for producing preservation-friendly DH projects.",,,"Guimont, Corinne",Virginia Tech,United States of America,North_America, ,gcorinne@vt.edu,,"gcorinne@vt.edu, alexk93@vt.edu","Guimont, Corinne;

While these flaws present challenges, this allows digital practitioners to identify and remediate these problems before they carry over to the new system.

Every migration of digital collections presents its own set of challenges unique to the institution and the platforms involved. Digital practitioners must think creatively and develop innovative solutions to overcome these challenges. This panel goes beyond offering migration strategies and encourages digital practitioners to undertake large-scale work on digital collections by re-framing migration as an opportunity for transformation rather than an obstacle to overcome. Panelists will share experiences with migration involving Islandora, CONTENTdm, ArchivesSpace, Knowvation, and in-house built digital content management systems. They will specifically speak to how they have taken advantage of migrations to advocate for additional resources, collaborate within and across institutions, evaluate usability, overhaul metadata, and otherwise optimize their digital collections.

Each presenter will begin with “two truths and a lie” to introduce their migration story before discussing their missteps, failures, and sacrifices inherent to the migration process. Presenters will showcase how these lapses shouldn’t be covered up, but instead utilized for the improvement of the repository.

All repositories document a diverse array of perspectives, but reflect the inherently racist and patriarchal institutions in which they were created. Migrations provide an opportunity to make known and break down these biases. As we prepare to migrate our collections, we have the opportunity to identify the role the collections have played in larger systems of oppression and attempt to dismantle those systems. Cultural institutions have a duty to present the content as it was originally created to promote research and analysis, but also serve as a platform to create awareness of the missteps of the past and provide context for interpretation. Panelists will discuss how they approached the issue of racism and bias in their repositories, including the creation of subject-based digital collections to highlight marginalized populations, the revision of metadata to replace offensive language, and the addition of a sensitivity statement.

Staff turnover led to responsibility for the program being placed in our hands; when a new AUL came on board with oversight over the program, we stepped forward to suggest a review (and volunteered to lead it). We envisioned an independent program with shared, collaborative leadership: a “production” leader responsible for process management and infrastructure development and a “community” leader responsible for education, outreach, and scholarship -- and we continue to work patiently and collaboratively to implement this vision. Most importantly, our driving ethos was building a responsive program with its own ambition, agenda, and shared values. Our program seeks to engage user communities with unique digital collections, produced collaboratively, inclusively, and openly.

We’ll detail what roadblocks and frustrations we faced but also the moments of satisfaction (and joy) along the way. We’ll also provide some tips for other programs looking to perform a complete overhaul or even implement some minor reforms while leading “from the side.” Institutional change can be difficult and frustrating; we’ll suggest, based on our experience, some approaches to facing those frustrations with persistence and humor.

Pregnant parents who carry a fetus with a prenatal diagnosis have data tracked from birth to adulthood. Data includes highly sensitive information about parents, obstetrical outcomes, and children; therefore, robust privacy measures are put in place to protect participant identity in this research. The project complexity requires appropriately managed identifiers to link data from multiple clinical systems. This data is intended to fuel new research and includes medical history, obstetric history, prenatal diagnosis and management, delivery outcomes, specific surgical details, family history, biological samples, and genomic data.

OBJECTIVES: Incorporate innovative privacy practices with traditional archival workflows during and as an integral component of a complex study’s active processes.

METHODS: Engage institutional compliance officers to establish a documentable solution upholding identity management for the protocol. Make recommendations to the technical/operational team for archival practices that maintain the provenance of data linked to a given patient.

RESULTS: For this specific case, we detail archival storage plans in the research protocol. We also inform patients in “lay language” that their protected health information (PHI) will be protected by honest brokering as well as stored permanently in the institutional archives.

CONCLUSION: Professional archival practices are new in the biomedical domain, and this case study is at the forefront of defining archival best practices for highly sensitive biomedical research that ensure personal information and data are preserved appropriately, all in order to advance patient outcomes.","INTRODUCTION: The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) operates a biobank following outcomes of children with congenital birth defects.

Each resource has been submitted by a member of the project team or by the broader community, and goes through a curation and review process by community reviewers prior to publication. In 2018, the Institute of Museum and Library Services awarded the DMTC a three year National Leadership Grant for its enhancement in four critical areas:

1. Expansion of the documentation model and search capabilities to include additional attributes that have been identified by users and by a metadata working group.

2. Development of integrated assessment capabilities in the DMTC that capture improved usage statistics, UI usability feedback, and learner and instructor feedback for training materials published in the DMTC.

3. Expansion and diversification of the content of the DMTC beyond the core of Earth science and research data management skill building - the early focus of DMTC collection development.

4. Targeted outreach to the academic library community to increase familiarity with and use of the DMTC, and engage the community in the continued development and growth of the DMTC.

This workshop will demonstrate the capabilities of the newly developed DMTC by:

1. Providing an overview of the DMTC and its capabilities with an emphasis on individual and small group exploration of the interface to discover skill building materials relevant to the topic areas of workshop participants.

2. Demonstrating the submission and curation process as an opportunity for workshop participants to gain an understanding of the underlying documentation model, and the submission, review and publication workflow for DMTC content.

3. Soliciting feedback from workshop participants on their experiences using the DMTC to discover materials of interest to them, and on the presented submission, review, and publication process.

4. Inviting workshop participants to join a growing community of content creators, content submitters, and reviewers.

Learning Outcomes:

1. Outcome 1 – Workshop participants will be able to use both the browse and search capabilities of the DMTC to find skill building materials relevant to their needs.

2. Outcome 2 – Workshop participants will know how to submit materials for integration into the DMTC and understand the underlying curation process to which those materials will be subjected.

3. Outcome 3 – Workshop participants will understand the various areas in which they could potentially contribute to the community activities of the DMTC: as content creators, submitters, and reviewers.

The planned outcomes of the workshop are to bring a broader familiarity with, understanding, and use of the DMTC and its content to the academic library workshop participants; to receive actionable feedback from the community that can be integrated into ongoing planning for future enhancements to the DMTC; and to invite new participants to the continued growth and diversification of content in the DMTC by serving as content creators, submitters, and reviewers.

Rather, it is an institutional imperative. Technical upskilling is as important as other types of professional development, and institutions should be encouraging their employees to collaboratively develop and promote their technical literacy.

In this presentation, two archivists and one librarian will reflect on over six years’ worth of promoting collaborative technical upskilling within the Curation team at the University of Michigan Bentley Historical Library. The presenters--who represent a number of diverse roles at the Bentley--will reflect on lessons learned from three consecutive initiatives: one provided opportunities for a small group to focus on a specific set of technical skills; another expanded the collaborative learning component of its predecessor by opening a variety of technical skills topics to the entire team; and still another provided an in-depth opportunity for a subteam to work on a single deliverable over a concentrated amount of time. The presentation will conclude with a “long view” of what went well, and what could be improved, with an emphasis on equity and inclusiveness. While the presenters come from a particular perspective, the audience should leave with relevant takeaways to bring to their own institutions, regardless of size or academic affiliation, and will be invited to share their experiences advocating for, promoting, or participating in technical upskilling throughout the presentation.","As archives and libraries expand their digital collections and services, acquiring or expanding technical skills is no longer the exclusive domain of individuals, although much of the professional literature on this topic might make it appear otherwise.

How can we responsibly use and archive big social data? This presentation suggests that robust data stewardship strategies developed to support qualitative data reuse can inform similar practices for big social data.,The ethical and epistemological challenges of research with big social data are well-established. How can we responsibly use and archive big social data? This presentation suggests that robust data stewardship strategies developed to support qualitative data reuse can inform similar practices for big social data.,"Big social data (such as social media and blogs) and archived qualitative data (such as interview transcripts and diaries) are similar, but their respective communities of practice are under-connected. Both types of research repurpose existing social data to advance discoveries in social science. Both also present challenges of context, informed consent, privacy and confidentiality, and intellectual property. However, despite these similarities, big social research has not yet been widely framed as a form of qualitative data reuse, and qualitative data reuse has only begun to be discussed through a big social data lens.

Qualitative data reuse is a more established practice, and therefore has more developed data stewardship strategies to support epistemologically-sound, ethical, and legal data sharing. Data stewardship strategies that support responsible reuse of qualitative data include data management planning, metadata schemes, and restricted access. However, issues still exist, including issues around scaling up qualitative research by combining archived data to support longitudinal studies and broader insights.

Data stewardship for big social data is less well-developed, and there is little consensus about how to maintain balance between transparency and protecting research subjects. Addressing this challenge is especially important when researching vulnerable or marginalized communities who connect via social media. While data stewardship practices could alleviate some of these challenges, such practices are still in development.

This presentation will focus on two resources currently under development: the impact assessment matrix and ethical guidelines for assessing reuse. The matrix helps practitioners to define and position activities along a use-reuse spectrum. Presenters will provide an overview of the matrix, both unpacking the distinctions between use and reuse and their various instances as well as highlighting the areas of continued debate. The ethical guidelines propose a set of core values, principles, and guidelines for the application of this assessment in a manner that accounts for the cares of GLAMR and stakeholder communities and the collections that they steward. Presenters will introduce the most current iteration of the ethical guidelines and discuss how practitioners can use it to develop more ethical, considerate assessment practices. Arguing that both the matrix and the ethical guidelines are needed to effectively and equitably assess use and reuse, the presenters will conclude the talk by articulating how the the two resources begin to address the lack of standards and common practices as well as by situating these outputs in the larger work of their IMLS-funded project “Digital Content Reuse Assessment Framework Toolkit.”","The DLF Assessment Interest Group Content Reuse Working Group is developing tools and documentation to better assess the reuse of digital objects.

It has become an entree to building new and meaningful relationships with colleges, departments, and campus services for whom common purpose with the libraries is not always easily visible or determined. Offering a web-hosting platform with built-in open source applications ready to use that is sufficiently flexible enough to accommodate diverse usage, positions UK Libraries as not only a service provider but also a collaborator in digital pedagogical practices and projects with faculty, staff, and students.

In this session attendees will learn more about CreateUK and how it is used to engage and partner with faculty and campus services. This session will conclude with an invitation for attendees to consider what opportunities they might create to engage their campus constituents in digital scholarship activities. Ideally, such reflection will yield additional ideas for positioning the library as a leader and partner in digital scholarship initiatives on campus.

Faceted search, also known as dynamic taxonomies, is a popular feature in digital libraries. Appearing as clickable labels, facets facilitate search results refinement and content browsing. To achieve its utmost efficiency, faceted search requires each facet value to be unique and simple concepts, that is, one vocabulary term represents one concept. However, cleaning up, updating and clustering facet values usually don’t happen prior to or during the digital libraries’ aggregation process. As a result, in the digital libraries, the same concept is expressed by different terms. The same term appears in different spelling variations. Outdated terms mingles with more up to date ones. Compound terms composed of multiple concepts forbids grouping content that share individual concepts. In short, a huge amount of improvement work is needed to optimize the faceted search. The University of Florida Digital Collections piloted the work with Samuel Proctor Oral History Collection, a high-profile national and international resource, using Oxygen XML Editor.

This presentation discusses an alternative model based on the Digital Library of the Caribbean (dLOC), which incorporates tenants of shared governance, mutual aid, generous thinking, community building, polycentrism, collaborative pluralism, and mutual dependency. Importantly, we discuss dLOC’s ways of working: utilizing concepts and methods from agile/scrum technical development and managerial theories based on fairness, fostering self-determination and supporting our communities.

dLOC’s alternative model is baked-in and extends through all aspects, including organizational design and technical development. For example, dLOC’s technical team follows agile and scrum for equitably engaging stakeholders to support each according to their needs. While agile and scrum are often utilized for deeply capitalistic ends, these are also methods that avoid top-down controls and instead enable voice of those most in need and most impacted by digital library technologies. These range from developers to stakeholders at partner institutions. Additionally, dLOC’s alternative model reflects concepts from progressive management theory that have developed over time in the literature but are not commonly applied to scholarship on digital libraries. These broad concepts include agency, procedural justice, and organizational support, and translate to meaningful work and community supports for other stakeholders and institutions.","Power inequities mean even well-intended libraries routinely disrupt people’s knowledge of and access to their cultural heritage.

- Ethics: Are there social or religious customs, or other circumstances—such as threats of personal or legal harm, or risks of exploitation of people, natural or cultural resources, or indigenous knowledge—that may or should impact digitization of the collections materials?
- Copyright: Are the collections materials protected by copyright and, if so, is the institution the copyright holder? If not, does a relevant copyright exception apply that permits creation and distribution of digital copies anyway?
- Contracts: Do provisions in gift or donor agreements limit the conditions under which digitization services or access can be provided?
- Privacy: Do the collections reveal information that could impinge upon the privacy rights of the subjects under federal and state laws?

TDM, a form of computational text analysis, is an increasingly relevant and prevalent approach to social science and humanities research. Researchers often rely on library-stewarded or licensed collections to support TDM, yet shy away from building and openly sharing diverse and representative corpora due to uncertainty around copyright and licensing restrictions. The perception of legal obstacles does not just deter research: it biases research by limiting researchers to particular topics and sources of data, leaving important questions unasked, and rendering TDM findings less broadly applicable. A growing body of research also demonstrates how race, gender, and other biases found in openly-available corpora have contributed to and exacerbated bias in the development of artificial intelligence tools.

Building LLTDM, first previewed in a 2018 DLF presentation, addresses these challenges through a framework and instructional materials for librarians and research professionals to develop copyright, licensing, privacy, and ethics literacies. Having now administered the Institute, we will leverage insights to cultivate community input and action on key calls to action surfaced by Institute: (1) moving toward TDM-friendly library licenses; (2) integrating the literacies into digital libraries to better serve computational researchers; and (3) addressing ethics at the intersection of digital library collections and computational research.","Drawing upon lessons learned from Building Legal Literacies for Text Data Mining (Building LLTDM; buildinglltdm.org), a recent NEH-funded Institute, we will overview actionable strategies for libraries to develop and implement core skills needed to navigate law, policy, ethics, and risk to better support text data mining (TDM) research.

The goal of these efforts is to arrive at a process that identifies and incorporates controlled vocabularies from marginalized communities, that respects their interests, and is not hindered by metadata formats or system technology.

One way to mitigate bias in metadata is to know about controlled vocabulary options that exist from historically marginalized communities. Within the Samvera Community, there is a working group developing guidelines and steps to determine when a controlled vocabulary is useful and how to find and evaluate a relevant controlled vocabulary for descriptive metadata creation. Another way to mitigate bias is to have options to easily incorporate controlled vocabularies for use from multiple sources. Cataloging/digital collection management applications have varying capabilities to enable term selection using different or multiple controlled vocabularies. Additionally, Linked Data vocabularies can connect terms between larger, less representative vocabularies (like Library of Congress Subject Headings) and terms from a community’s vocabulary to aid and instruct end users conducting research online. Yet another way to disrupt metadata bias is to support communities who are providing controlled vocabularies. Working through steps to discover and use controlled vocabulary options from marginalized communities helps to center those communities’ concerns by advocating to use terminology from those communities in descriptive practice and encouraging software improvements to better support varied controlled vocabulary use.","Mitigating bias in metadata is not a finite task but this talk shares experiences in identifying ways to disrupt metadata bias.

This presentation will consider ways that people and organizations can build radical empathy within and across a virtual community.","In ArchivesSpace we take great pride in having built a strong virtual community over the years. Like much of the U.S., in March 2020 nearly everyone in our community confronted a new reality that kept them from their physical spaces, disrupted their regular routines and cut them off from their usual in-person professional and personal interactions. In math or physics a constant remains the same in all circumstances and all conditions. For many in our community, ArchivesSpace has become their constant in this time, and we have leapt into action and responded to the call -- developing new programs, shoring up well-established ones, being a steady presence as people sought things that would get them through the workday. Thousands of our users have attended events, requested help or just been in touch since the coronavirus crisis began.

But what happens when ""the constant"" is confronting a version of that same new reality? In a field of helpers, how can we signal for empathy from others and allow ourselves to need help?

Like much of the U.S., in March 2020 nearly everyone in our community confronted a new reality that kept them from their physical spaces, disrupted their regular routines and cut them off from their usual in-person professional and personal interactions. In math or physics a constant remains the same in all circumstances and all conditions. For many in our community, ArchivesSpace has become their constant in this time, and we have leapt into action and responded to the call -- developing new programs, shoring up well-established ones, being a steady presence as people sought things that would get them through the workday. Thousands of our users have attended events, requested help or just been in touch since the coronavirus crisis began.
But what happens when ""the constant"" is confronting a version of that same new reality? In a field of helpers, how can we signal for empathy from others and allow ourselves to need help? This presentation will discuss some ways that people and organizations can provide the support needed by those they serve without sacrificing themselves.

The web-based project consists of three categories of modular toolkits that--in combination with each other--form innovative assignments where students engage with library collections and expertise. By combining relevant critical literacies to contextualize a research project, a digital primary source packet, and a digital scholarship toolkit, faculty can assemble meaningful assignments that meet pedagogical goals for hybrid or online classrooms. Instead of focusing primarily on technical tools, we take a problem-based approach, framing the hypothetical use of a kind of digital scholarship tool in terms of their fit with subject matter and desired teaching outcomes, while also proposing potential assignments.

Our goals in this project are to demystify digital scholarship and pedagogical methods for our faculty, grow the library’s strong connection to the curriculum during a time of crisis, create new opportunities in the curriculum for Special Collections and Digital Scholarship, and share knowledge and resources with the broader professional community. The toolkits also provide a way for faculty to engage in exciting pedagogical projects while maintaining equitable access to materials for students who are unable to physically access library materials.

It will also discuss our approach to consultations with members of the campus community, including the research office, university administration, faculty, HR, and others in order to create data models for a wide spectrum of scholarly activities. This will equip the Research Information Management (RIM) system to capture data related to outreach, community engagement, open access, international collaboration, and other measurements that have traditionally been elusive or gathered piecemeal. Together these steps provide a fuller picture of faculty activities beyond those represented in harvested citations.

It will also discuss our approach to consultations with members of the campus community, including the research office, university administration, faculty, HR, and others in order to create data models for a wide spectrum of scholarly activities. This will equip the Research Information Management (RIM) system to capture data related to outreach, community engagement, open access, international collaboration, and other measurements that have traditionally been elusive or gathered piecemeal. Together these steps provide a fuller picture of faculty activities beyond those represented in harvested citations.
Finally, the presenters will initiate a conversation with attendees about the library’s role in managing institutional data of this nature. Important components of this discussion will explore how to communicate the limitations of citation data to the campus community and how to develop a more nuanced picture of scholarly activity representative of all faculty.",,,"Macken, Megan",Oklahoma State University,United States of America,North_America, ,megan.macken@okstate.edu,,"megan.macken@okstate.edu, clarke.iakovakis@okstate.edu","Macken, Megan;

This resource provides a more concrete understanding of the queer past by serving as a platform for educators, students, and researchers. It offers:

1. A searchable, annotated directory of archives and libraries relevant to LGBTQIA+ research across the country.

2. A descriptive catalog of digital projects connected to queer sexuality and sexual representation.

3. A timeline of major events in the history of sexuality to help ground and pique public interest.

4. A bibliography of histories of sexuality reviewed and annotated by historians of sexuality, and librarians active in sexuality fields. Ranked ranked for audience reading level, sortable by topic, time, and place, and presented online in an open and easily-searchable format.

Built on the Omeka S platform, 50YO uses the Homosaurus LGBTQ linked data vocabulary, which is developed and maintained by an international queer community. Thus it serves as a demonstration of the possibilities of ethical description and cataloging for digital libraries.

This project validates and contextualizes existing fictional collections. Second, it is a peer-reviewed reference resource for educators and students, among others. Finally, this project provides a valuable resource for libraries developing displays for Pride events, window displays and exhibits in the stacks.

We support graduate students in building capacity for campus-wide training in data and computational scholarship. Presenters will discuss program design, initial outcomes, and future plans.","Across disciplines, rapidly growing interest in digital and data-intensive scholarship creates a largely unmet need for critical training in technical skills. To address this need, the University of Arizona Libraries allocated funding to test a one-year pilot with four graduate fellows. Our program, the Digital Scholarship and Data Science Fellowship (DS2F), is intended to build capacity for campus-wide training in data and computational scholarship. It address three known challenges in contemporary higher education: (1) insufficient training for data-intensive, computational research within subject disciplines; (2) uneven attention to digital pedagogy and strategies for teaching technical concepts within graduate training programs; and (3) a need for ongoing development of modular curricula that can be integrated into the classroom and extracurricular workshops or used independently by scholars and researchers at the point of need.

Our pilot launched in January 2020 with a series of workshops whereby library subject matter experts trained graduate students on technical and pedagogical skills. In turn, the students embarked on a process of self-directed learning with projects related to digital scholarship and data science, culminating in a series of open workshops that extend their knowledge to the campus community. Librarians’ instructional sessions (1) build connections between the cohort and mentors, (2) teach the basics of instructional design of short-term, modular workshops, (3) convey best practices in digital pedagogy, and (4) discuss open educational resources and open licensing. Early indicators from our pilot suggest that the model is successful and extensible even under the current constraints of the pandemic.","Across disciplines, rapidly growing interest in digital and data-intensive scholarship creates a largely unmet need for critical training in technical skills.

Our presentation addresses the fourth WCAG conformance requirement. This states organizations need to build or acquire web content that is compatible with the assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) that users with disabilities rely on to interact with the web. We draw it to the attention of the DLF Forum, because it is arguably the most complicated requirement. As the WCAG authors note, it is tied to sociological factors, including social and economic status of users.

Our presentation describes the situation this requirement puts libraries in using easy to understand and humanizing terms. We draw on our experiences as a sighted web and user experience librarian at a Canadian university and a blind accessibility specialist for the National Network for Equitable Library Service (NNELS), which provides books for users with print disabilities through Canadian public libraries.

Despite the complexity of this requirement, we offer two questions everyone can ask to make it simpler. First, we can ask about the assistive technologies people with disabilities in our communities are using. Second, when talking about web content we either develop or purchase, we can ask does it work with the assistive technologies our users rely on?","Digital libraries are expected to be built with features that recognize people with disabilities (PWD) as valued, contributing members of society.

CRRJ serves as a resource for scholars, policymakers, and organizers involved in various initiatives seeking justice for these crimes.

This panel will share the experiences of the collaborative team involved in building the Burnham-Nobles Digital Archive, which builds on CRRJ investigative records to create a public archive and database. This archive will be presented on a website which provides access through functions that center the victims, allowing family members and researchers to continue seeking justice and understanding of racially motivated violence.

The Burnham-Nobles Digital Archive, by furthering the CRRJ’s mission of restorative justice, shows how digital projects and archival records can honor families and communities who have endured racial violence. The archive is being built by a collaborative team of experts with diverse specialties in law, historical and legal research, and archival and information science -- meeting the CRRJ's vision for this archive requires institutional commitment and support for building a broad team. The work of the Burnham-Nobles Digital Archive team is centered on record-keeping as accountability for past racial violence and its ongoing effects today.

The project is nearing the end of the design process, using the expertise of CRRJ investigators, archivists, metadata experts, digitization specialists, data engineers and website designers at Northeastern University Library. The collection organization, metadata structures, and technical infrastructures next move into a testing phase which will evaluate both functionality and methods used to center the victims represented in the collection.

Raymond Wilkes will first discuss the CRRJ project’s investigate method, approaches to data and organization, current restorative justice projects, and the relationship between the investigator and archivist. Gina Nortonsmith will next discuss mission-driven archiving as represented in the CRRJ project: designing systems which represent and honor real people. Her presentation will touch on stakeholder dialogue and coordination of needs between CRRJ and the library, project management which straddles multiple library departments, and developing strategic technical directions in partnership with CRRJ project leaders. Amanda Rust will follow with a discussion of methods for facilitating the connection between project stakeholders and the data engineer and software developers that will build and refine underlying databases and new interfaces in support the CRRJ. Then, Drew Facklam will represent her work on this project from the perspective of metadata creation and its effects on the interoperability between the University's MODS-based Digital Repository Service (DRS) and the specialized collection-specific archival site.

While user research and needs analysis for Studio X began several years ago, designing for the program and space started in earnest in the fall of 2019 with the launch of the space and program planned for September 2020. Starting any new program requires time, experimentation, and relationship building; all of which were complicated by the shift to exclusively online engagement brought about by COVID-19. For example, our first dedicated hire for Studio X started three weeks before the university moved everyone to remote work. And by April, due to distancing restrictions brought about by COVID-19, construction of the space was delayed by a year. Further, implementing an XR program, in particular, as a sustainable university-wide initiative posed serious challenges under these conditions. An effective XR initiative depends heavily on a physical space, the availability of hardware and software, expertise, and a reliable internet connection. XR technologies, despite their rapid development, are still considered inaccessible due to the cost and lack of widely available equipment and expertise. Demystifying XR requires hands-on workshops, showcase events, and access to equipment in order to foster curiosity and inspire potential users to see new possibilities and forge cross-disciplinary connections. While not impossible, on-boarding new users and developing these critical relationships in a virtual landscape is difficult. To adapt to these challenges, we shifted our focus to virtual conversations and workshops. Like most programs, we started exploring how we could more fully engage our faculty and students online. In this panel discussion, we present four different perspectives that underline some of the diverse expertise and viewpoints that made it possible for us to continue building a community for Studio X while in the midst of a pandemic. 

 

Emily Sherwood, Director of the Digital Scholarship Lab, will discuss the history of the program and efforts towards community, programming, and space development undertaken prior to March 2020. Maurini Strub, Director of Assessment, will talk about her contributions to focusing on faculty interviews and student surveys for surfacing user needs during the pandemic, which also helped our community feel engaged in the process of determining our services and programming and kept them informed of developments. Meaghan Moody, Immersive Technologies Librarian who began her role right before the pandemic, will provide insight into how she has continued to build community, programming, and interest in XR, including sharing best practices on teaching XR methods and tools remotely as well as strategies for developing internal and external partnerships. Sebastian Jakymiw, the Karp Library Fellow Immersive Technologies Developer, started working with Studio X in June 2020. He will discuss his perspective as an undergraduate student helping shape the programming and vision for Studio X and the importance of peer-to-peer networks and learning for engaging community.","As an upcoming hub for extended reality (XR) at the University of Rochester, Studio X aims to foster a community of cross-disciplinary collaboration, exploration, and peer-to-peer learning that lowers barriers to entry, inspires experimentation, and drives innovative research and teaching in immersive technologies.

A pre-recorded presentation will be followed by a community dialogue in the “watch party” designed to foreground the diverse perspectives of DLF attendees.","For the last five years, we have run a series of face-to-face “Toolshops” at the University of Pittsburgh that brings members of our academic community together to build shared metacognitive practices as we explore our relationships to networked, technical systems. We are helping to co-create an intellectual environment where we contribute all of our knowledges—about content, about the practice of learning, and about being human—to the group.

The abrupt transition to emergency remote teaching prompted us to transition the core of our Toolshop work online via the development of a series of co-learning encounters that facilitated problem-solving alongside open-ended inquiry. During this time of enormous transition, we wondered together, how can we support one another as we redefine our expectations, approaches, and identities as both teachers and learners? Using the topics of critical digital pedagogy, archives, and “thinking like a computer,” we were interested in expressing thoughts in, through, and about technical systems while also exploring issues such as trust, authority, grief, and temporality. We considered the ways we could release our control of the conversation in the emotionally bereft online environment without feeling we were abandoning the Toolshop community. We engaged with the capacious affordances of domestic spaces, the workings of liberatory pedagogy, and the critical importance of generous practice within the academy. To engage with the practice we describe here is to accept the role of co-learner; one active participant among many in a cooperative that encourages growth, change, and complexity.

We propose an innovative approach to the DLF panel presentation format. We will offer a ten-minute, pre-recorded presentation and use our remaining thirty-five synchronous minutes to facilitate a co-learning encounter in the watch-party space designed to foreground the diverse perspectives of DLF attendees. During this period of interactivity, we will work directly with the watch party to think metacognitively about their relationships to a piece of educational technology that they either loathe or could not do without (or both at the same time). We will then ask questions and facilitate interactions that prompt the externalization of their professional and affective experiences with these technical systems. Prompts will include: “What role does trust play in your use of this technology, and has this trust changed since March 2020;” “Do you find that this technology has replaced in-person behaviors you used to enjoy? Do you feel any grief around the loss of these in-person behaviors, or do you feel liberated;” and “In what ways might these technologies assert your authority in the classroom (or in your research) without your permission?” In the process, we will model co-learning facilitation, an approach to pedagogy that insists that we believe, listen to, and learn from one another’s experiences.

These techniques can turn undifferentiated digitized images into usable data and metadata.","In this talk I will explore the advantages of using 'serverless' technology, in particular AWS Lambda, for the automated conversion and analysis of digitized documents. For example, a recent project for the British Library that processed twenty thousand images of historic UK legislative documents involved the following functions:
- image format conversion (JPEG to Pyramidal TIFF)
- image splitting (two page scans to single pages)
- document boundary detection using custom Clarifai models
- text extraction using optical character recognition (OCR)

I will show how serverless has numerous advantages over traditional single-machine techniques including speed, scale and cost. I will also discuss its suitability for a wide variety of other metadata extraction techniques, including image segmentation, handwritten text recognition (HTR), natural language processing, entity recognition and computer vision. These techniques can be applied to turn undifferentiated digitized images into a usable database containing document data and metadata. This allows the rapid identification of matching documents for users, as well as providing researchers with additional raw data for bulk analysis.","In this talk I will explore the advantages of using 'serverless' technology, in particular AWS Lambda, for the automated conversion and analysis of digitized documents.

","Museums and collecting institutions are quickly pivoting their exhibition strategies to maintain relevancy during our global pandemic. Uncertain times have fostered creative, affordable and effective solutions. This presentation will give you the tools and guidance to bring your collection online.","We may feel disconnected during social isolation, but in a lot of ways, digital access has given us the tools to be even more connected than ever before.

Thank to COVID, many institutions have had to close their doors or limit access due to social distancing, reduced staff, and budget constraints. But, challenges breed opportunity. Organizations around the world are pivoting and finding new ways to share their collections. They are turning their walls inside out and bringing their artworks and cultural artifacts online—expanding their reach and impact.

Now, more than ever, there are benefits to having a strong online presence. You are not limited to physical constraints like gallery walls. You are not limited to geographical boundaries. People outside of your community can engage with your collection.

Artwork Archive works with collecting institutions around the world and knows how nonprofits are moving their collections online, establishing virtual exhibitions, connecting with existing and new audiences, and even getting creative with scavenger hunts and online fundraisers.

The Albin Polasek Museum & Sculpture Gardens will serve as a case study. They'll share how they turned an online art inventory management system into a platform that promoted their mission, collections and artists across the globe. Despite closed doors, they still created an impact in their community.

Attendees will come away with best practices for:
- creating virtual exhibitions
- continuing to educate their communities with limited resources and budget
- soliciting donations and fundraising online
- giving artworks and artifacts a new life with online access

After a recent significant redesign of the University of Tennessee’s Digital Collections website, a usability study to assess users’ experiences with the new features was carried out using Loop11. Participants were recruited from English 102 classes that were using the site to complete a primary source assignment. In pursuing real information needs, the participants searched for topics as diverse as moonshine and body image. Their experiences were captured using screen recordings, heat maps, and written feedback. This data was used to analyze the effectiveness of new website features, including a Learn More page, collection groups, and a way to limit searches by resource type. While many of the participants were able to use these features successfully, the study identified ways to improve the site for more efficient search and navigation. In particular, the data indicated that participants had difficulty narrowing the records to the most relevant results. In addition, the placement of the “Learn More” section was not intuitive for most users. An unintended outcome of the study was the increased integration of Digital Collections resources into standard library instruction sessions as a result of collaboration with liaisons while preparing the study and recruiting participants.

This interactive program features panelists who will discuss opportunities to increase the visibility of libraries on popular websites and expand engagement with community members beyond established physical and virtual library locations.,"Libraries struggle to remain relevant and reach members of their communities in an environment of proliferating information sources. Studies have shown that libraries reach only a small percentage of current and potential users through traditional channels such as library websites because most people do not begin their research at a library. Instead, they usually turn to search engines and familiar non-library websites first when looking for information.

Recent events have highlighted the importance of community access to information and cultural heritage. While the Covid-19 pandemic has greatly increased demand for open and electronic resources, the racial injustice propelling the Black Lives Matter movement has underscored the work that must be done to create equal access to cultural material. Libraries are tasked with addressing social justice in their communities, and a necessary component of this is broadening access to library resources beyond the library’s physical boundaries, and beyond its existing patrons

In this program, panelists will discuss new ways librarians can connect with people in the non-library websites they regularly consult for information. They will demonstrate the success that partnerships with some of the largest consumer and education sites have delivered in increasing the visibility of libraries, and show how community members can benefit by being able to reach libraries easily from their favorite websites.

Panelists representing a cross-section of library types and sizes and commercial organizations will also discuss opportunities for partnerships that increase the visibility of unique special collections related to cultural heritage and social justice.

During this interactive program, participants will share their own approaches for engaging hard-to-reach information seekers in their communities and will have the opportunity to brainstorm additional tactics. Participants will leave the program with recommendations for new strategies to try when they return to their libraries.

","Digital artifacts pose new challenges for delayed-release archiving. To protect our historical record for future generations, we propose Strong Dark Archives (SDA), a blended administrative and technical protocol for securing delayed-released archival materials among networks of libraries.","Archivists regularly contend with a wide range of security threats, including data breaches, inadvertent loss, and legal coercion by those hoping to make sealed records public. These threats are particularly salient when sensitive materials are donated with delayed-release conditions.

Trust in archivists’ ability to enforce such conditions gives donors the confidence to enter into the historical record materials that they might otherwise destroy. But as these materials are increasingly born-digital (and therefore hackable, convenient to exfiltrate en masse, and more easily corrupted), and as governments and private parties become ever more aggressive in their efforts to secure early releases, we must innovate in order to stand still.

To compensate for these new dynamics, we propose Strong Dark Archives (SDA), a blended legal and technical protocol for securing delayed-released archival materials among a network of libraries. SDA leverages modern cryptography and institutional agreements to coordinate access-control across multiple accredited archival organizations, providing broad resilience to data breaches, technical failures, and legal process. Through this distributed approach to security, SDA imposes meaningful friction on efforts to force the early disclosure of archival records.

Deploying SDA will require bringing together the expertise of archivists, lawyers, system engineers, cryptographers, and others. We hope that participants of DLF will be inspired to apply the SDA protocol in a wide range of use cases, including archival of personal papers, disinformation on social media platforms, and sensitive corporate materials. With the guidance of this community, SDA stands to introduce a new level of trust to delayed-release archiving.

Started in the 1970s as a collaboration between the Iowa labor movement, the University of Iowa Labor Center, and the State Historical Society of Iowa, ILHOP has grown into one of the largest, longest-running labor-focused oral history projects in the world.

Now, as the project retools for the digital age, it faces challenges and opportunities associated with managing a large oral history project over time. Since 2013, with the support of new partners and a series of national grants, project staff have collected hundreds of new born-digital interviews, digitized over one thousand analog interviews, made the digitized collection accessible online, and begun the process of transitioning a 2003 print index into a complete, expandable, and keyword searchable digital index.

While this recent work has greatly expanded ILHOP’s reach and significance, it has also created new challenges for project management. This presentation will focus on the shortcomings of controlled vocabulary for indexing and metadata creation. Both the structure of the 2003 index (developed for interviews focused on the 1930s-1960s) and LCSH terms have frequently been insufficient for describing the project as it has grown and evolved over time.

Our intention is to demonstrate the extensive collaborations necessary to create, sustain, and make accessible long-term oral history projects.

Since 2013, with the support of new partners and a series of national grants, project staff have collected hundreds of new born-digital interviews, digitized over one thousand analog interviews, made the digitized collection accessible online, and begun the process of transitioning a 2003 print index into a complete, expandable, and keyword searchable digital index.
While this recent work has greatly expanded ILHOP’s reach and significance, it has also created new challenges for project management. This presentation will focus on the shortcomings of controlled vocabulary for indexing and metadata creation. Both the structure of the 2003 index (developed for interviews focused on the 1930s-1960s) and LCSH terms have frequently been insufficient for describing the project as it has grown and evolved over time.
Our intention is to demonstrate the extensive collaborations necessary to create, sustain, and make accessible long-term oral history projects. Our audience is those of all skill levels interested in oral histories, historical diversity, and digitization project management.",,,"Baumgartner, Justin",University of Iowa Libraries,United States of America,North_America, ,justin1982@gmail.com,justin-baumgartner@uiowa.edu,"justin-baumgartner@uiowa.edu, john-mckerley@uiowa.edu","Baumgartner, Justin;

We’ll explain the philosophy behind these tools, explore an example repository, and direct you to additional resources.","“Minimal computing” is a paradigm for building digital projects that emphasizes building only what is needed, minimizing long-term maintenance and over-design, and maximizing ephemerality, accessibility, and justice. Wax is one tool that emerged from the Minimal Computing Working Group in order to empower the digital scholarship community to build digital collections minimally. This focus on ethics in technology and the low barrier to entry make Wax a great fit for library digital projects, and drew our attention as data visualization educators looking for a robust platform to host example data visualizations and their source datasets as part of the IMLS-funded Visualizing the Future Symposium project.

Wax leverages Jekyll, a static website builder with a native “collection” framework that ports nicely to digital scholarship collections. Building on top of Jekyll means Wax-based projects can be hosted publicly for free on GitHub. Wax adds functionality for metadata, image processing, and search and image gallery interfaces, allowing collection builders to focus on collection objects rather than software development.

In this 15 minute session, we will provide:

1. A quick conceptual overview of Wax as a minimal computing tool and how it relates to Jekyll

2. A deep-dive use-case demo of a Data Visualization Examples Repository, and

3. Highlights of other Wax examples and resources for learning more

The turn to the past allows to interrogate and rewrite/reimagine a US history where Latinx voices are not disregarded or erased.,"This panel focuses on the use of underrepresented archives to reconfigure how we understand the past and imagine a more inclusive future. We specifically take into account the ways that US Latinx archives are often disregarded, erased, misrepresented, and misused. Not only are such archives overlooked, but their producers–who often identify as non-white and/or not along heteronormative identities, and write in languages other than standard English–are not considered to be legitimate parts of history. Turning to the past creates new ways of understanding US history by filling in the gaps and re-presenting US Latinx peoples as active participants and contributors to the social, economic, political, and cultural fabric of the nation.

The US Latino Digital Humanities program (USLDH) at the University of Houston draws from the rich archival collections at Recovering the US Hispanic Literary Heritage (Recovery) in order to make visible the legacy of Latinxs in the US. Recovery is an international program to locate, preserve and disseminate Hispanic culture of the United States in its written form since colonial times until 1960. The program has compiled a comprehensive bibliography of books, pamphlets, manuscripts and ephemera produced by Latinxs.

During this panel, we will discuss the types of materials available in the Recovery collections, the attention to ethical choices when dealing with underrepresented archives, and the critical interventions that can take place at pedagogical and research levels. We claim that the use of archival materials in the undergraduate classroom has the potential to create a student-centric understanding of public history. Our panel will focus on how prioritizing underrepresented archives shifts the perspective of history. We then examine the usage of Omeka class assignments in which students learn about metadata and consider how to describe items, especially those in languages other than English. We will describe how this type of assignment teaches students to crucially think about how knowledge is produced and who produces said knowledge.

Furthermore, the panelists will describe the active ways that Recovery/USLDH engages with the community to preserve and raise awareness of history. This includes postcustodial archives, community events, and public history initiatives that serve to involve community members and community historians in the preservation and sharing of knowledge.

Woodruff Library (AUC Woodruff Library) supports the teaching, learning and research missions of four institutions of higher learning that comprise the world’s largest consortium of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Like all institutions of higher education, the Library faced a quickly changing landscape with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. In addition, the killings of George Floyd and Rayshard Brooks by police and the resulting protests for racial justice highlighted the need to collect born-digital materials related to these historic events. While the Library was already exploring ways to improve digital and archival workflows and be more responsive and time-sensitive in archival collecting efforts, the pandemic and racial justice protests served as catalysts to hasten these efforts.

This panel presentation will consist of three panelists from the AUC Woodruff Library. The presenters will focus on three areas affected by the events in our rapidly changing world. The first topic is the remote management of digital projects. Responding to the pandemic required a quick and agile pivot from managing an onsite digitization program and three different grant projects to staff working remotely while continuing to provide digital services and support. The presenters will provide strategies employed by AUC Woodruff Library staff to continue managing digital projects and programs in a remote environment.

In addition to the general shift to managing digital projects remotely, the Library also had to consider that the events that affect our communities are happening quickly and oftentimes in an ephemeral digital environment. In order to collect and preserve a more complete version of the history of the HBCU campuses and greater Atlanta Community, the AUC Woodruff Library Archives Research Center is developing responsive collection development initiatives. The presentation will discuss the Library’s shift from passive collection development to learning to adapt quickly to the needs of the community and to the events happening in real-time. To increase active engagement with the community, the Library is strategically defining the collection scope as needed and introducing easy-to-use ways of gathering stories and materials in real-time.

The presenters will conclude by providing concrete examples of projects undertaken by AUC Woodruff Library in response to the shifting environment introduced by the pandemic and racial justice protests. First, the Library initiated a project to collect materials documenting the experience of the Atlanta University Center community during the COVID-19 crisis. The presenters will provide detail about the process of promoting the project, collecting the materials and stories, and making them accessible on the institutional repository. A second project using Archive-It to capture web sites, social media posts, and news relating to these events in the AUC community will also be examined. The presenters will cover workflows and issues around realizing these projects and discuss lessons learned and future plans.

These research collections come from a variety of domains and are organized to maximize understandability and reproducibility.

Descriptive metadata enrich and enable display of collection file hierarchies across a variety of systems, enabling dataset linking and discovery. Given the size of the collections (each potentially tens of thousands of files and terabytes of data), these metadata need to be both automatically-generated to the extent possible and manually curated.

An extensive requirements-gathering phase, paired with iterative testing of available software (including Oxygen, Altova XMLSpy, and a novel JSON Editor) made clear several challenges for our environment: the use of separate source control repositories for each collection, which enable ongoing contributions directly from researchers, made existing software inapposite; while large collection record sizes resulting from providing item-level descriptions complicated editing workflows.

We noted that, beyond the typical landscape of metadata management, software development workflows often involve and have solved many of these same concerns. With this in mind, we began to think of metadata management as development. Pairing open-source components with custom tooling, we designed an “Integrated Development Environment” (IDE) -- a text editor with custom components and settings -- specifically for metadata management. This modular system supports large-scale batch changes, data validation, and status checks across collections, while remaining easier to support and further develop than other, monolithic software solutions.

Based on El Diario de la Gente, the independent newspaper primarily published for and by Chicanx students at the University of Colorado Boulder between 1972 and 1983, the project represents a window into the extraordinary yet complicated history of the Chicanx Rights Movement in Boulder, the state of Colorado, and the world. The authors and editors covered a wide range of topics, including boycotts and protests, the tragic events surrounding Los Seis de Boulder, and the friction between the Chicanx student community and the university administration. The activist newspaper also served as a creative platform for poetry, art, and literature. Digital El Diario aims to highlight that history through five interdisciplinary student readings of the newspaper that employ DH methods, techniques, and values learned in the course. By way of publishing a plain-text corpus of El Diario, we hope others will continue to explore, interrogate, and celebrate the history of Chicanx student activism.","This presentation offers student and instructor perspectives on the role archival justice can play to enable the exploration of a variety of digital humanities (DH) literacies and competencies in an discipline-agnostic DH graduate course, from exploring computational approaches such as text mining and geospatial analysis, to postcolonial values and feminist collaboration.

The two-week intensive gathered over 60 faculty and staff from across Macalester College to collaborate and share ideas about teaching. During our daily gatherings on Zoom, we discussed pedagogical concerns and strategies pertinent to emergency remote teaching and learning, but that we also hope to carry forward beyond the current crisis.

Throughout the engagement, we discussed a range of topics, including active learning, equity, accessibility, anti-racist pedagogies, assessment, trauma-informed teaching, and ways to effectively engage students.

The critical digital pedagogy framework, articulated by Jesse Stommel, Chris Friend, and Sean Michael Morris, necessitates close scrutiny of technology, and this was key to discussing timely ethical and logistical concerns. Building from the premise that technology is flawed, our workshop focused on how we can purposefully and mindfully engage with colleagues and students during a time when we are physically isolated. We talked about the significance of context; the spaces in which we are teaching and learning, as well as the places in which tools are created and disseminated.

This presentation will discuss findings from this illuminating experience. I went into the workshop with the expectation that we would benefit from the content of the readings and the sharing of our collective wisdom. However, we greatly surpassed my expectations in terms of developing a meaningful and safe community in a virtual space.

This presentation examines the community activism and archival work in Minneapolis, Minnesota related to anti-police violence against BIPOC. Specifically, it highlights the work of young black activist Wanja Kuria, who, after Floyd’s murder, began protesting racism, state sanctioned violence and documenting the ways in which the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement is operating on the ground. A novice in archivist activism, Kuria’s work focuses on the intersectional community response to the dual pandemic threats through art and protest. Kuria navigates these spaces despite financial constraints and, at times, complicated grassroots politics. She considers the ways in which posters, memorials, spoken word, and music compilations frame the protest space. Through interviews, site visits and participant observation, the audience is transported through Kuria’s phone camera (iPhone XR) lens to witness community activism and archiving on the ground and outside of the mainstream media gaze.

This panel discussion will explore the types of knowledge management necessary to the project’s work, and the tools and practices that have served us well as we move from prototype to production. Specifically:

* Dr. Martha Olcott (faculty team lead) will discuss the knowledge management difficulties inherent in creating a digital archival collection from disparate sources, while trying to insure that the long-disadvantaged national, ethnic, and religious communities that made up the USSR are given sufficient voice in the project. She will discuss how we secured donations of material and/or permission to digitize content from multiple institutions, and what practices are emerging for her and her team to sort through and prioritize content.

* Megan Kudzia (digital scholarship librarian) will discuss development of the project's map functionality, especially any modifications made to the Neatline beta plugin for Omeka S, and the technical next steps for developing the project. Finally she will discuss the final research product at MSU Libraries, and our current plans for a long-term home for the project and collections.

* Keelyn O’Brien (graduate student) will talk about developing the educational plugin: what we hope to do, where we are so far, what challenges we’ve run into, and next steps.

* Sofia Cupal (MSU graduate), with contributions from Michael Downs (graduate student), will discuss the development of metadata best practices, as well as the steep learning curve for developing project workflows for digitization, description, and project management.

In this presentation, I will outline my survey of subject headings in a dataset of approximately 7,100 EAD files collected through keyword searches from OCLC’s ArchivesGrid using a combination of text analysis techniques with AntConc, Voyant Tools, and XQueries. Generated from keywords related to LGBTQ identities, I use “queer” as a case study to trace the word across the corpus to investigate similarities, differences, and discrepancies in archival description and LGBTQ identities. While I am interested in locating and mapping queer terminology, I pair this analysis with tracing instances of hate speech and outdated terminology across the corpus. By looking at networks of LGBTQ terminology, I explore the role of subject headings in archival description to represent, label, and, perhaps, mislabel queer identities and subjects. By outlining how this survey joins the work of scholars like Thomas Padilla who explore “archives as data,” I will discuss the difficulties and potential outcomes of utilizing digital humanities methods to consider questions of scale across institutions and encoding standards.

Indeed, the pandemic served for many communities as a forcing function to determine better mechanisms of online participation. While still far from perfectly equitable (particularly on the accessibility front), the organizations represented on this panel were better able to achieve many of their goals and reach broader audiences than they would have otherwise. Likewise, quickly shifting to online meeting modes forced a reexamination of priorities and de facto decision-making practices that often goes into planning for in-person conferences.

Join representatives from the IIIF Consortium, the LD4 Conference planning committee, and CLIR/DLF as they discuss the opportunities and the pitfalls prompted by the pandemic pivot. In March, the IIIF Consortium had to cancel their major annual conference event with typical attendance of roughly 300, and replaced it with an online event in the span of 7 weeks that ended up reaching 1200 attendees from 40 countries. The LD4 Conference shifted from a two-day in-person conference scheduled for May to a virtual event held throughout the month of July with over 1500 attendees from at least 26 countries. And of course, CLIR’s DLF Forum and affiliated events are striving to take equity and inclusion to heart in their shift to online programming, using the online format to foster the same spirit of peer learning, community, and professional development for which they are known.

We intend to inspire attendees to take the lessons these organizations have learned and implement them in their own work, whether that’s hosting virtual department meetings or tailoring programs to the needs of remote students, scholars, and other interested parties.

Panelists will cover logistical questions, including fundamental issues of structure, format, and scheduling (especially given international audiences) to maximize inclusion and participation. Panelists will also discuss what worked for their communities, including successful community engagement efforts, and compelling, low-cost technology platforms, as well as what didn’t work: platform pitfalls, engagement gaps, and accessibility failures. Discussion will also center on areas that need more long-term critical examination, how panelists have thought through efforts to keep momentum going after the event, including ties into other programming and communication channels. Likewise, depending on the ability to do real-time Q&A or online response, panelists are eager for all attendees to join in an open discussion about what works and what doesn’t in terms of building community while apart.","We can’t meet safely in person, but communities are still the center of how we move forward as a sector – we can and must still gather to share best practices and celebrate each other's work.

Wikidata is a free and open ontology serving as a central knowledge base for all Wikimedia projects. However, it increasingly also informs external systems operated by the likes of Google, Facebook, and Amazon, widely recognized for their algorithmic black boxes. In contrast, Wikimedia spaces' self-documenting transparency illuminates such socio-technical black boxes, facilitating critical engagement and procedural insight. Wikidata as a ‘democratized’ platform holds the promise of a ‘counter-hegemonic’ ontology; one where objectivity arises at the intersection of multiple, per Haraway: situated, knowledges. However, we find even within Wikidata significant hegemonic dynamics; issues with inclusivity and respect for local and minority knowledge; designed-as-descriptive models unfurling prescriptive power; and users reading ‘truth’ into what was intended only ever to be verifiable.

Analyzing these issues (which similarly beset sociotechnical library systems) by observing Wikidata praxis from a pedagogic-theoretical perspective leads us to propose the concept of ontology literacy to ground knowledge representation in social exigencies rather than political–economic agendas or technological affordances. We argue that ontology literacy can help foster critical understanding of the sociotechnical world and responsible use of knowledge-representation systems in the libraries and beyond.","How do we equip learners with the critical skills and practice required for working within the ecosystems of structured data and formalized knowledge representation that compose modern life?
