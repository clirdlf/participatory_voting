Key to sifting through the possible options is the need to find out from others what has worked for them, and what has not.  In order to guide our choices at the University of Alabama Libraries, we developed a survey to uncover the selection of practical tools, the development of productive workflows, and recommendations that more experienced digital archivists have to share.  In May we are distributing this survey widely, and in June and July we will sift the results to generate guidelines that are useful for a range of material types, media, and formats. 

We will begin the session by sharing the results of our survey, and asking attendees if they have useful tools to demonstrate or practical workflows to share in the areas of intake, selection, processing and access of any form of digital content.  Based on their responses and the interest areas of the attendees, we will divide into small groups around either the stage of workflow or the types of content (or both).  Attendees will be invited to share their own positive and negative experiences, and each small group will be asked to add notes to our shared Google Document, and to then share highlights of their discussion with the larger group. The Google Document will serve as a basis for future reference, and participants will be invited to contribute to the ongoing development of best practices and guidelines that will help the community more effectively manage incoming digital content.  

The intent of this presentation is to engage participants in sharing useful information and tools, and to expand the capabilities of all participants to better manage their own incoming digital content.

As a library student on the same campus, I started collecting tweets. The collection today contains 3,002 tweets. All of them live on my computer. And in the process of thinking about a permanent home for the collection, I realized: I had to start over.

Librarians are prospecting for opportunities to connect with faculty and students at multiple stages in the research lifecycle.

They are seeking to advise on data management and data visualization in the same way they have advised on publishing or copyright issues.

To meet website acquisition goals, many institutions rely on the expertise of external web archiving services; others, with in-house staff, have developed their own web archiving services. Regardless of the approach, the rate at which textual, visual, and audio information is being produced and shared via the web, combined with the complexity and specialized skills and infrastructure needed for web archiving 6 processes today – from capture through quality assurance, description, and eventual discovery, to access and analysis by researchers – poses significant resource and technical challenges for all concerned.

The Act requires that official electronic legal material be: (1) authenticatable; (2) preserved, either in electronic or print form; and (3) accessible. The Keep Electronic Edicts Preserved & Secure (KEEPS) solution was specifically designed to satisfy requirement (2).  The UELMA requirements for preservation and security state that if official legal material is preserved in an electronic record, the official publisher shall:
(1) ensure the integrity of the record;
(2) provide for backup and disaster recovery of the record; and
(3) ensure the continuing usability of the material.

The software system was built in-house using staff programmers and existing commercial products.  These products are: a virtual machine, write once read many (WORM) disk, a relational database, and a tape backup application.   Additionally, a custom software application was deployed to the virtual machine.  The emphasis of this presentation is a description of the custom software application written in Java.

Fortunately the advances of cloud computing have drastically lowered the bar for activities like bioinformatics data processing. Users can create a virtual machine to perform bioinformatic analysis on data in minutes, and need only pay while that computer is running.  During the spring of 2016, members of Lewis & Clark College’s Watzek Library and Biology Department partnered to use Amazon Web Services cloud computing to support research and lab activities. From this experience, the presenters view this approach as a very realistic and applicable model for Library/IT support of campus bioinformatics activities on the cheap.

Partnering with a college in an attempt to improve their research is politically attractive and likely to build good will on the campus, providing both tangible and less-quantifiable values to help libraries demonstrate their value on campus. 

At Loyola Marymount University, a medium-size, private institution, three librarians were tasked to assist faculty in the publishing process, in particular, help faculty choose credible and reliable open access journals in which to publish. Assisting faculty in the selection of appropriate venues for their research output is well within the library’s mission.

Today’s research libraries and archives recognize website archiving (“web archiving”) as an essential component of their collecting practices, and various programs to archive portions of the web have been developed around the world, from within national archives to individual institutions. To meet website acquisition goals, many institutions rely on the expertise of external web archiving services; others, with in-house staff, have developed their own web archiving services. Regardless of the approach, the rate at which textual, visual, and audio information is being produced and shared via the web, combined with the complexity and specialized skills and infrastructure needed for web archiving 6 processes today – from capture through quality assurance, description, and eventual discovery, to access and analysis by researchers – poses significant resource and technical challenges for all concerned.

The collaborative approach and open mind-set from the research groups and the library service demonstrate that these GLAM tools can be successfully deployed in research projects and, more importantly, have the potential to grow further in the domain of Digital Humanities.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2016-May-12 04:07,,048,2016 DLF Forum,Panel,"Asencio, Miguel (2); Dinsmore, Chelsea (1); Taylor, Laurie (1); Jefferson, Rebecca (1)","1: University of Florida, United States of America; 2: Florida International University, United States of America",,Navigating the Waters of a Caribbean Digital Library,,"Change Management, Leadership, Community of Practice, Caribbean Studies, Collaboration",,,"The Digital Library of the Caribbean (dLOC) began in 2004.

The dLOC Model focuses on how a community of practice can best create a digital library in terms of contents, functionality, and robust governance for inclusivity and diversity. In the dLOC Model, partner institutions agree to shared goals and processes to support joint directed action and procedural justice following a governance structure for: inclusive and distributed collection development where partners select materials, permissions-based infrastructure (partners retain all rights to materials), functional hubs, decentralized/local digitalization, collaborative activities to develop the community of practice and increase capacity through collaboration.   

dLOC began in 2004. In the past 12 years, dLOC has successfully transitioned: 

• Moving from grant-project funding to institutionalized, programmatic funding. This also grew to include a complementary member funding model to support higher levels of ongoing growth for both content and capacity. Member funding supports the dLOC Seed Grants and trainings for partners. 

• Growing from 9 to 40 partner institutions (universities, colleges, libraries, archives, government agencies, NGOs, publishers, and scholarly societies) as well as many contributing scholars and private collectors. New materials and contributors are supported through the dLOC Model with partners, community-sourcing, and growing the community of practice

• Growing from the initial launch with a handful of newspaper clippings online to holding over 2.5 million pages (6.8 million pages) of books, archival letters, photographs, audio, video, research data, newspapers, and other materials. dLOC is now the world’s largest open access library of materials from and about the Caribbean and circum-Caribbean. 

• Growing the leadership team to add new roles, including for the dLOC Digital Scholarship Director
• Transitioning with dLOC’s new Program Director, Technical Director, and Digital Scholarship Director at the administrative and technical host institutions, with dLOC as a learning organization for new people and new ways of working

In this panel presentation, dLOC team representatives will discuss dLOC’s model for international collaborations, relationships, and partnerships, including change management, building and sustaining a community of practice, and work as a learning organization with changes in scale and scope. Presenters include dLOC’s new Program Director, Technical Director, Digital Scholarship Director, and the Judaica Collections Coordinator.  The Digital Scholarship Director and Judaica Collections Coordinator are new roles. New roles and the changes with new team members as the Program Director and Technical Director are all developed and evolve in collaboration with the dLOC partner institutions and dLOC’s governing groups of the Executive Committee and Scholarly Advisory Board. Over the past 12 years, dLOC has developed through collaboration into as a socio-technical (people, policies, communities, technologies) platform supporting collaboration among partner institutions, developing and enhancing communities of practice, and building intellectual infrastructure. In this panel presentation, presenters will cover governance and community collaboration as the foundation for prior and future growth, as dLOC continues to evolve in the digital age.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2016-May-12 08:30,,0
