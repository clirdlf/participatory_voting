By looking at the origin and development of institutional repositories through the lens of digital preservation practice, an argument will be made that the IR community needs to move away from locally run infrastructure and consider how best to scale our efforts at the national level, in order to effectively connect to digital preservation processing and distributed storage services that necessarily operate at-scale. By looking at successful at-scale Canadian examples of the pairing of repositories and digital preservation in adjacent domains, we hope to encourage the preservation community to recognize the importance of, and advocate for, a highly- scaled, community-led institutional repository environment that can help academic and research libraries meet their digital preservation goals.

","As Digital Production and Preservation Manager for Stanford University Press’s Mellon-funded digital publishing initiative, I want to tell the story of how we’re preserving the digital scholarly monographs we’re publishing, with the aim of identifying how each of our approaches (web archiving, repository storage, and documentation) reframes a publication’s story.","As part of a Mellon grant to develop a program for the publication of interactive web-based projects, Stanford University Press is employing three methods for persisting projects once they’re published: web archiving, repository storage of code and content, and in-depth documentation of the user experience. In this presentation, I will use the example of a recent SUP publication to demonstrate how each of these approaches privileges a unique version of the story comprising the published work. For example, a web archive preserves the interactive surface of the project, emulating a reader’s engagement with the content, thus foregrounding the polished publication for an audience whose primary interest is the project’s field of study. Alternatively, a repository collection offers access to the story told by the project’s underlying code and platform, serving the interests of researchers of digital architecture or history. Finally, documentation, including narrated screencast and written description of the user experience, removes the technical fragility and non-accessibility of the web archive or repository collection, telling yet another version of the story. While not providing a replicated experience or the raw files for reconstruction, documentation serves as an accessible description, albeit one re-centralizing the author’s voice, for better or worse.

If a digital scholarly monograph, and the arguments it contains, is already itself a story, fraught with implications of author and audience, then its archived iteration is another story. The question is: what voices and audiences are inherently privileged in our approach to preserving these new works?

In this cautious and unpredictable environment it is imperative that leaders communicate with 100 percent authenticity. Boiler-plate responses and memorized copy and paste press releases will not work.,"During the first 15 minutes Shaan Rais will engage the crowd colorfully in vivid descriptions of what true authenticity is and how it translates to effective communication in the workspace. Humorously detailing examples of success and failure through storytelling. The audience will laugh, relate, and let their guard down to learning as rapport is established.

During the second segment of the keynote, 15 minutes will be strategically utilized to personalize authenticity to each leaders’ personal brand. Many people are under the assumption that true authenticity exists separate and apart from their true identity and story. Nothing could be further from the truth. The more of ourselves that we bring into the workspace, the more authentically we communicate. When our direct reports search for inconsistencies there are none to be found. This also offsets any feelings of inauthenticity, undue stress, and cognitive dissonance that occurs from having to leave our proverbial authentic self at the door of the establishment. When people are able to be genuine, honest, and comfortable in their skin in any organization, sentiments of organizational citizenship and loyalty are established. Thus, lowering attrition, heightening retention, and strengthening organizational culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout all levels of the organization.

In the last 15 minute segment of the keynote, Shaan will deliver an authenticity accountability call to action within an Authenticity Development Strategic Action Plan. This ADSAP will come with identifiable challenges, goals/objectives, and desired dates of completion. For the purpose of identifying and rectifying three areas of opportunity to strengthen effective authentic communication. Replete with follow up and coaching opportunities.

This may accomplish the task, but at a cost. Algorithms for data integrity can be optimized for specific purposes to decrease environmental impacts and increase system efficiency. ","Fixity is often practiced as a one-size fits all approach for demonstrating the integrity of data, with preferences for using strong cryptographic algorithms. This may accomplish the task, but at a cost. Algorithms for data integrity can be optimized for specific purposes to decrease environmental impacts and increase system efficiency.","Auditing fixity shouldn’t be done with a blunt hammer, but a toolbox with specific tools for each job. Blunt tools may get the job done, but if over relied upon can have a significant negative environmental impact. It is unnecessary to use cryptographic checksums in every case to demonstrate the integrity of digital content.

Data integrity can be broken down into three types: transactional, authentication, and fixity-at-rest. Each type can use an optimized approach to increase overall sustainability. Transactional fixity checks or checking integrity when files move between storage media and systems, can be securely accomplished with CRC or MD5 checksum algorithms. Authentication fixity checks or proving the file hasn’t changed since it was received over a long time, is well suited for strong cryptographic checksums such as the SHA2 and SHA3 families. Fixity-at-rest approaches may vary upon the infrastructure storing the content with some infrastructure being able to internally achieve and prove fixity-at-rest.

By choosing different approaches for different fixity use cases and decreasing universal reliance on strong cryptography, digital preservation practitioners can achieve the goals of data integrity while reducing CPU cycles and wear-and-tear on storage media, resulting in increased environmental sustainability and system efficiency.

This talk will not address all issues related to demonstrating authenticity but focuses only on data integrity.

Understanding Misinformation: A Lesson Plan Toolkit was built collaboratively by a team of professional library staff and library student employees. It provides instructors who wish to facilitate learning about misinformation with sample learning outcomes, learning activities, assessment tools, and further resources that support lesson plan design. The Toolkit presents misinformation as a systemic issue, and emphasizes that the best way to address it is by building a collaborative learning environment—whether in-person, online, or hybrid -- that gives participants opportunities to reflect, share, and explore together. It is ultimately meant to be generative, and encourages users to adapt and remix the resources provided as well as craft their own learning outcomes according to the needs of their distinct learning communities. The speakers will describe the creation of the Toolkit, and provide a brief demonstration.

We provide a community update and will share the strategic planning process undertaken by the community to develop a roadmap for Fedora post-6.0 release.","The newest version of Fedora, 6.0, sought to strengthen Fedora’s digital preservation sensibilities, data transparency and commitment to community standards by incorporating the Oxford Common File Layout. This presentation will highlight the newest, most important features of Fedora 6.0 as well explore the mightation tooling created as part of an IMLS Grant focused on lowering barriers to migration.

With a growing need to move into the future, we have focused efforts on incorporating more modern tools to our offering. From cloud infrastructure via S3 and Docker, to fixity and the Fedora API, we will outline all that 6.0 has to offer. We will also demonstrate how all roads to 6.0 are now open thanks to much needed migration tooling and utilities. As part of our post-6.0 development the tech team also released the Camel Tool box which is a suite of microservices that allows integration with Fedora and we will discuss Camel Toolbox use cases and how community need, lead to community shared development of this feature.

Lastly, with no extensive feature roadmap on the horizon, the Fedora community has focused inward on strategic planning for the program’s future. The community began to evaluate the program from all angles and, using the It Takes a Village (ITAV) framework created by teams at LYRASIS, a sub-committee began work on charting a path forward. This presentation will also talk about our work with ITAV and how open source communities can benefit from the insight we have gained throughout the process.

The project’s success illustrates how digital collections focusing on the stories of historically marginalized groups can be an important site for student learning and community engagement.","Librarians are working to counterbalance collections decisions and priorities that have historically marginalized the histories and experiences of people of color. Critical digital scholars have also highlighted the need to disrupt the replication of this marginalization in the digital sphere. Meanwhile concerns about diversity, cultural competence, and the marginalization of students of color in STEM and librarianship continue.

Libraries can use critical digital collections in response. This presentation will focus on an open access digital resource built at Indiana University Bloomington Libraries - Land, Wealth, Liberation: The Making & Unmaking of Black Wealth in the United States - which has seen significant uptake from the campus and community and attracted diverse student workers.

Librarians and students built this resource on a Libraries-hosted digital exhibition service based on Omeka S, which allowed for rapid, collaborative and distributed development, and integration of embedded audiovisual content and interactive timelines. The primary timeline spanning 1820-2020 offers an alternate construction of significant historical periods, tying them to events that directly affected black communities, such as the 1921 destruction of Greenwood, Tulsa, and the federal urban renewal policies initiated by the 1949 Housing Act. Librarians actively engaged students in developing their skills in scholarly communication, open access, and digital methods.

The success of this project opens new doors for collaborative digital scholarship projects between the Libraries, the campus, and the community, and illustrates that digital collections focusing on the stories of historically marginalized groups can be an important means of addressing multiple concerns.
