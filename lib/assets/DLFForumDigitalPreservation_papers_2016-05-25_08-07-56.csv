Key to sifting through the possible options is the need to find out from others what has worked for them, and what has not.  In order to guide our choices at the University of Alabama Libraries, we developed a survey to uncover the selection of practical tools, the development of productive workflows, and recommendations that more experienced digital archivists have to share.  In May we are distributing this survey widely, and in June and July we will sift the results to generate guidelines that are useful for a range of material types, media, and formats. 

We will begin the session by sharing the results of our survey, and asking attendees if they have useful tools to demonstrate or practical workflows to share in the areas of intake, selection, processing and access of any form of digital content.  Based on their responses and the interest areas of the attendees, we will divide into small groups around either the stage of workflow or the types of content (or both).  Attendees will be invited to share their own positive and negative experiences, and each small group will be asked to add notes to our shared Google Document, and to then share highlights of their discussion with the larger group. The Google Document will serve as a basis for future reference, and participants will be invited to contribute to the ongoing development of best practices and guidelines that will help the community more effectively manage incoming digital content.  

The intent of this presentation is to engage participants in sharing useful information and tools, and to expand the capabilities of all participants to better manage their own incoming digital content.  We additionally hope to begin a new DLF/NDSA interest group to build on the information gathered and work together to develop clear, practical guidelines for the community in the various aspects of management of born digital materials.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,"We are proposing to present a version this at both DLF and NDSA, in order to build a community effort around a priority topic of interest.",,,,2016--1800:00,2016--2700:00,0,,,,,,

And what followed was a massive collection of tweets written by marginalized and underrepresented students who are - throughout history, and still today - left out of our campus histories, and our narratives, and our archives. 

As a library student on the same campus, I started collecting tweets. The collection today contains 3,002 tweets. All of them live on my computer. And in the process of thinking about a permanent home for the collection, I realized: I had to start over. 

I begin here by saying, yes, there are merits to acting quickly when working collecting Twitter data. But when we work quickly, and on a whim, what do we miss? In taking a step back, I remembered to consider my perspective - that of a white student - and its intersection with a movement led by students of color. Were these tweets mine to take? To hand off to an institutional repository? All without the consent of the movements creators?

These practices are practical for any institution under most circumstances.
The OHS Digitization Division continues to be a forerunner in modern research capability through continuous examination of outmoded components and their modern usage. Exploring cultural heritage requires the exploration of all types of recorded sound from wax cylinders to vinyl recordings, magnetic wire to magnetic tape. Without uncovering these abilities through education, practice, and community efforts, and accommodating each mode and format, the institution of historical transference fails. 
The conveniences of available playback equipment and limited preservation knowledge reduce in importance moments in time which leads to incomplete historical experiences. As archival archaeologists it is imperative to explore and develop processes which coincide with institutional vision and to explore the cultural material accessed in order to convey factual interpretations which attaches meaning and clarification of actions from our past.

Librarians are prospecting for opportunities to connect with faculty and students at multiple stages in the research lifecycle.  They are seeking to create students who are data-literate as well as information-literate.  They are seeking to advise on data management and data visualization in the same way they have advised on publishing or copyright issues.  Providing these new types of support means acquiring new skills.  Armed with boundary-spanning strategies to connect disciplines plus practical approaches to data science and visualization, subject liaisons have the potential to work in lockstep with the aims of supporting current and future researchers.  The Data and Visualization Institute for Librarians, developed by the North Carolina State University (NCSU) Libraries, offers a curriculum in data science and visualization to the library community.  The goal of this institute is for participants to develop knowledge, skills, and confidence to communicate effectively with researchers and be able to provide initial consultancy on the topics covered.

Today’s research libraries and archives recognize website archiving (“web archiving”) as an essential component of their collecting practices, and various programs to archive portions of the web have been developed around the world, from within national archives to individual institutions. To meet website acquisition goals, many institutions rely on the expertise of external web archiving services; others, with in-house staff, have developed their own web archiving services. Regardless of the approach, the rate at which textual, visual, and audio information is being produced and shared via the web, combined with the complexity and specialized skills and infrastructure needed for web archiving 6 processes today – from capture through quality assurance, description, and eventual discovery, to access and analysis by researchers – poses significant resource and technical challenges for all concerned.

Before 2012, mass digitization was performed on a smaller scale, and focused primarily on collections in Special Collection and University Archives. Digitization needed to expand beyond these collections because of the wide variety of rare materials in the Libraries’ collections in seven campus libraries, and because of the growing demand to provide digital access of these materials to students and other patrons. The establishment of a digitization department under the Information Technology division in 2012, instead of under a collection area, helped to establish the infrastructure for digitizing materials across all campus libraries. This presentation will discuss the logistics of establishing a cross-divisional, cross-collection area digitization program, including how the program is funded which grew from about $35,000 to nearly $200,000 from 2013 to 2016.

This can be a hurdle for small colleges, as these high powered computers are expensive and support may not be readily available. 
Fortunately the advances of cloud computing have drastically lowered the bar for activities like bioinformatics data processing. Users can create a virtual machine to perform bioinformatic analysis on data in minutes, and need only pay while that computer is running.  During the spring of 2016, members of Lewis & Clark College’s Watzek Library and Biology Department partnered to use Amazon Web Services cloud computing to support research and lab activities. From this experience, the presenters view this approach as a very realistic and applicable model for Library/IT support of campus bioinformatics activities on the cheap.

Partnering with a college in an attempt to improve their research is politically attractive and likely to build good will on the campus, providing both tangible and less-quantifiable values to help libraries demonstrate their value on campus. 

At Loyola Marymount University, a medium-size, private institution, three librarians were tasked to assist faculty in the publishing process, in particular, help faculty choose credible and reliable open access journals in which to publish. Assisting faculty in the selection of appropriate venues for their research output is well within the library’s mission.

The presentation will share the process of developing a rubric, the results of a pilot conducted with select faculty and feedback from liaison librarians testing the rubric with open access journals in their respective liaison areas.

Today’s research libraries and archives recognize website archiving (“web archiving”) as an essential component of their collecting practices, and various programs to archive portions of the web have been developed around the world, from within national archives to individual institutions. To meet website acquisition goals, many institutions rely on the expertise of external web archiving services; others, with in-house staff, have developed their own web archiving services. Regardless of the approach, the rate at which textual, visual, and audio information is being produced and shared via the web, combined with the complexity and specialized skills and infrastructure needed for web archiving 6 processes today – from capture through quality assurance, description, and eventual discovery, to access and analysis by researchers – poses significant resource and technical challenges for all concerned.

After all, free software is often said to be “free as a free puppy”, learning new technologies and building fresh skillsets requires dedicating a great deal of time to experimentation in exchange for fewer concrete deliverables, and setting aside administration-friendly projects for more radical collection development can be politically risky.

Yet, a growing number of professionals have responded to these challenges, setting up alchemical shops beneath the ivory tower at an intersection of web development, information organization, data visualization, archiving, and more conventional academic librarianship.  This emergent community kludges together bits of code to transmute controversial social media feeds into archival content, provides advice to faculty on digital humanities projects, develops applications to scrape edgy student blogs, and employs FOSS platforms to harvest, serve, and reuse open data -- all the while writing scripts to clean grungy metadata and wondering how RealMedia files fit into a fifty-year preservation plan.

The dLOC Model focuses on how a community of practice can best create a digital library in terms of contents, functionality, and robust governance for inclusivity and diversity. In the dLOC Model, partner institutions agree to shared goals and processes to support joint directed action and procedural justice following a governance structure for: inclusive and distributed collection development where partners select materials, permissions-based infrastructure (partners retain all rights to materials), functional hubs, decentralized/local digitalization, collaborative activities to develop the community of practice and increase capacity through collaboration.   

dLOC began in 2004. In the past 12 years, dLOC has successfully transitioned: 

•	Moving from grant-project funding to institutionalized, programmatic funding. This also grew to include a complementary member funding model to support higher levels of ongoing growth for both content and capacity. Member funding supports the dLOC Seed Grants and trainings for partners. 

•	Growing from 9 to 40 partner institutions (universities, colleges, libraries, archives, government agencies, NGOs, publishers, and scholarly societies) as well as many contributing scholars and private collectors. New materials and contributors are supported through the dLOC Model with partners, community-sourcing, and growing the community of practice

•	Growing from the initial launch with a handful of newspaper clippings online to holding over 2.5 million pages (6.8 million pages) of books, archival letters, photographs, audio, video, research data, newspapers, and other materials. dLOC is now the world’s largest open access library of materials from and about the Caribbean and circum-Caribbean. 

•	Growing the leadership team to add new roles, including for the dLOC Digital Scholarship Director
•	Transitioning with dLOC’s new Program Director, Technical Director, and Digital Scholarship Director at the administrative and technical host institutions, with dLOC as a learning organization for new people and new ways of working

In this panel presentation, dLOC team representatives will discuss dLOC’s model for international collaborations, relationships, and partnerships, including change management, building and sustaining a community of practice, and work as a learning organization with changes in scale and scope. Presenters include dLOC’s new Program Director, Technical Director, Digital Scholarship Director, and the Judaica Collections Coordinator.  The Digital Scholarship Director and Judaica Collections Coordinator are new roles. New roles and the changes with new team members as the Program Director and Technical Director are all developed and evolve in collaboration with the dLOC partner institutions and dLOC’s governing groups of the Executive Committee and Scholarly Advisory Board. Over the past 12 years, dLOC has developed through collaboration into as a socio-technical (people, policies, communities, technologies) platform supporting collaboration among partner institutions, developing and enhancing communities of practice, and building intellectual infrastructure. In this panel presentation, presenters will cover governance and community collaboration as the foundation for prior and future growth, as dLOC continues to evolve in the digital age.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2016--1200:00,,0,,,,,,

Our journey hasn’t been smooth, but we do have a few campfire stories to share with you of the lessons we have learned. Namely, surviving three iterations of website redesigns, planning for metadata support, suspect material selection practices, and individual partner engagement. 

Clemson forged its own trail to digitize and describe these images, and build a place for them to call home. The website redesigns were costly and time-consuming due to a “design by committee” mentality. This trail was made difficult from the beginning, with no initial support for metadata in the original grant. The Clemson team traveled the country to conduct onsite scanning and collect materials, which were not often fully processed or described.

nkaysha1@swarthmore.edu",,,0,"This workshop explores how Jekyll, a popular static site generator geared toward minimal blogging, can actually be a powerfully simple way to share library content while using minimal resources as well as a tool for collaboration. At our library, we found an increasing demand for on-the-fly sites designed around repurposing existing digital content. Classes might want to consolidate and showcase scattered projects they assembled in Scribd, TimelineJS or Soundcloud. Physical exhibits might want to spread their impact through attractive, modest digital exhibits of materials already hosted elsewhere.

For basic web development, librarians often turn to PHP-based tools stacked on top of MySQL databases, whether Omeka or Wordpress. These tools clearly excel in some cases--large-scale projects, ones featuring troves of media content or those with a variety of contributors. But for many projects, such platforms are simply overkill. Databases have large footprints and unnecessarily hide the underlying architecture. Above all, such content management systems (CMS) depend on an institutional commitment of infrastructure and support, which is clearly not an option in many library settings. 

Static site generators such as Jekyll cherry-pick the best features of a full-blown CMS. Yet they require a fraction of the resources, need no maintenance and age gracefully. We will cover the basics of setting up a Jekyll site and discuss the freely available tools for collaborative authorship and publishing. We will focus on quick, reusable workflows that demonstrate how to engage students, faculty and librarians in web development as a process, even under constraints.

Learning outcomes:

1) Learn how to build a static website and perform basic customization in Jekyll in order to adapt the tool to specific library projects.

2) Demonstrate how static sites can be collaborative processes and opportunities for computing literacy in order to develop a more nuanced understanding of the range of web development tools available for particular library needs.

3) Articulate the benefits of using minimal computing in terms of allocating library resources more effectively as well as fostering an inclusive ecosystem of digital projects not limited to well-supported institutions.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2016--1200:00,2016--1500:00,0,,,,,,

However, collections are often developed to focus on the interface and its retrieval functions first (e.g. string search, faceting) before considering how the objects will be used and by whom. There is a method for joining these two concerns: an object-oriented approach emphasizes the importance of considering resource design and use before their representation and description.

The field of user experience (UX) suggests developing an understanding of your audience before creating your metadata to ensure that your content is findable by users in order to fulfill a real information need. Bringing together librarians, developers, curators and other members of your team to collaboratively model the content will put the focus on the items’ unique qualities and your patrons’ information needs. In so doing, more specific questions about how the objects interrelate will allow for a more nuanced understanding of the types of information-seeking strategies the collection can facilitate. Similarly, this object-oriented approach allows for strategically viewing metadata values from the perspective of content strategy while serving various discovery services. Consequently, it is possible to more critically evaluate how metadata connects the object with audiences..

In an effort to alleviate this problem, the Lee Library at Brigham Young University teamed up with a student Capstone team from the Ira Fulton College of Engineering.  The result was a working prototype of a revolutionary scanning device designed to significantly increase throughput on scanning of many types of cultural heritage materials, including unbound manuscripts, photographs and negatives.
This new scanning device uses digital backs, web cams, lasers, a giant mousepad, and spinning parts to produce FADGI 4-star compliant images at speeds similar to the conveyor belt scanning system famously in use by the Smithsonian Institution. However, this innovative device has the advantages of a smaller footprint, lower cost, the ability to scan transparent media, and it can be operated by one person.
Early testing indicates that a variety of document types can be safely scanned at speeds eight to ten times faster than currently achieved with traditional flatbed scanners. Patents on the design are pending and the Lee Library is currently seeking industry partners to work on further development and distribution of this technology to libraries and archives everywhere.

Considerably avante le lettre, the GRI has activated a decentralized network of contributors who provide the controlled vocabularies with new terms. Rather than rely on a vast population of anonymous amateurs who make infrequent or minimal contributions, the Getty Vocabularies solicit contributions from approved cultural heritage institutions that are vetted and adhere to a highly sophisticated set of editorial standards. The vocabularies are then released back to the community free of charge through a web interface or, in the case of AAT, TGN, and ULAN, as Linked Open Data. 

From its humble beginnings in 1714 in the form of the Inducement Prize Contest, the history of crowdsourcing is largely one of extractive labor practices that benefit a central authority. The digital technologies that have enabled the share/mesh economy and produced “cognitive surpluses” have enabled more ethical forms of engagement (as well as more virulent forms of the negative practices) but challenges remain. 

This presentation proposes the Getty Vocabulary Program’s contribution processes as a model of crowdsourcing that engages with a number of concerns that crowdsourcing provokes. We will contextualize contemporary crowdsourcing efforts in the GLAM communities, frame the Getty Vocabularies as a crowdsourcing project, address the impact of LOD, and detail how this model of crowdsourcing could inform future projects at the GRI and beyond.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2016--1200:00,,0,,,,,,

We conducted 27 semi-structured interviews with Global Midwest awardees, and coded them using a qualitative content analysis.  We then analyzed the coded interviews into quantitative visualizations that display the extended network of the Humanities Without Walls community. 
Our interviews explore how scholars share data, build self-generated research environment infrastructures for supporting data sharing and communications, and frame their collaborations in the context of broader goals. In our preliminary analysis, the prominent themes were:
Adaptive Research Practices: Scholars noted challenges in project management and organizing workflows between researchers with differing methodologies and disciplinary philosophies.
Diverse Modes of Scholarly Publication: Scholars employed diverse, frequently digital modes of dissemination and publication;  
Networks of Scholarship: The scholars frequently cited the networks of scholarship that they built through these collaborative projects, and how the research engaged them with  with multiple communities.

Our quantitative network analysis of the HWW Global Midwest partnerships further reveals how collaborative initiatives expand the global impact of humanities scholarship.

Like scholars in other fields, musicologists continue to face standards for tenure and promotion that discourage and even prevent them from initiating significant and potentially valuable projects in digital musicology. 

In January 2016, the NEH funded a workshop that gathered an international group of music encoders, metadata librarians, and musicologists at Texas A&M University to discuss these issues. Workshop participants proposed a procedure for peer-reviewing digital editions, projects, and resources in music, and they began discussions to establish a metadata standard for describing those projects so that they can be interoperable with other digital humanities scholarship. With these standards set, the foundation has been laid for Music Scholarship Online (MuSO), the first virtual research environment dedicated to music research through digital peer review and aggregation.

Based upon these recommendations, OSUL chose to construct a preservation repository based in a FEDORA environment layered with Hydra heads for access and other functional requirements. For several years the Libraries utilized a limited access FTP server designated the “Dark Archive” to store its digital master files. Unfortunately, the Dark Archive had also been a space where a variety of digital project files-masters, derivatives and administrative files, but often little metadata-had been summarily placed when a share-drive had failed several years earlier. Therefore, before we could begin our migration into the MOR, we had to get a handle on what we had- what were the master objects to be migrated and what, if any, metadata existed?

In Fall 2015, the River Campus Libraries hosted a Data Dive that brought together undergraduate students and local nonprofit organizations. The Data Dive was an expression of several of the most important roles of the library: bringing together the university and the local community; giving students a safe space to begin to engage with a larger scholarly community; and providing an opportunity for hands-on application of the tools and techniques students learn in classes. 

The students brought their skills and enthusiasm for working with data, and the community organizations brought data and questions they hoped to get help with. Over the course of two days, the students, working hand-in-hand with librarians and library staff, immersed themselves in the data and devoted themselves to finding insights for their partner organizations. While the workload was daunting – the students had no prior exposure to the organizations they worked with, and many had no experience working with data at all – by the end of the weekend, the students were able to present analysis and visualizations they developed.

Training Games sought to answer the research questions “Does a semester-long digitization training program increase the knowledge and digital imaging skills of student technicians?” and “Can such a program positively affect the confidence of student imaging technicians in his or her work?” By guiding them through nine assessments and scanning challenges, the inaugural class received the opportunity to learn new scanning techniques for basic items often received in the lab. During the program, Lab staff were able to assess student technician’s knowledge, verify and update scanning manuals, and affirm scanning standards. Following the completion of the program, students received a certificate of completion, certifying their skills as basic digitization technicians.

This panel aims to identify gaps and opportunities for researchers developing data-centric projects that integrate a wide variety of research stakeholders. By focusing on programmatic solutions for scholars both with and without significant institutional support while still maintaining data curation flexibility across the research lifecycle, the papers presented as part of this panel, with a focus on training, infrastructure, services, and access, will suggest a series of questions and potential solutions that are central to developing data-management and sustainability workflows for data-driven humanities research in the context of libraries.

Academic libraries are often seen as the home for data curation services, but not without close partnerships with campus groups like central information technology, research offices, and researchers themselves (Muñoz and Renear, 2011; Poole, 2013; Gold, 2010).  Initiatives like Council on Library and Information Resources’ data curation postdoctoral fellowships (http://www.clir.org/initiatives-partnerships/data-curation) and the NEH-funded Digital Humanities Data Curation Institute (http://www.dhcuration.org/institute/) articulate the importance of institutional backing and reinforce key ways that libraries and library staff in partnership with scholars are situated to support data curation across the research lifecycle. Because humanities research is often archivally-focused, natural partnerships between humanities researchers and library faculty and staff form with implications for digital humanities scholarship (Maron and Pickle, 2014).

Despite the special place libraries may occupy in cultivating (digital) humanities research, the existing suite of data curation services are often incomplete or inadequate, motivating those of us who support data curation activities to fill the gaps with third-party solutions or customized one-off solutions for a specific project. Or more often than not, we set aside the unaddressable needs in hopes that they can be addressed in the foreseeable future. The three sets of multi-institutional, library-scholar partners who make up this panel will address the gaps between ad-hoc curation and programmatic solutions while still being mindful of the organic nature of humanities research data.  In particular, these approaches to data curation methods and sustainability management take into account the following important characteristics of humanities research data and humanities research practices:  1) humanists tend to create data not just gather data, 2) some of this data is inherently structured, but most is not, 3) the resulting data is often highly interpretative, which has implications for sharing and re-use, 4) data creation is often iterative and layered with implications for copyright, versioning and active working spaces, and 5) the process is as important as the product (Posner, 2015; Muñoz and Renear, 2011).

The DMR has traditionally focused upon the stewardship of assets and the delivery of these resources to an end user.  For the past decade, my scholarship has explored the recontextualization of digital assets, which I refer to as the “Russian Doll Effect.”  Investigating the reuse of artifacts through a variety of online environments and hardware devices has been exciting; however, while the contexts and usage environments varied, the overall arc remained characteristically linear.  
In recent years, some DMR collections have begun to evolve beyond this model: stretching the ""one-way"" paradigm into a more circular, reflexive, and spiraling asset lifecycle in which existing digital objects spur users to create derivative artifacts, which are then also added to the repository and linked in parity to the original asset that inspired it.

As part of this new direction, NIO is launching a new program called National Digital Initiatives. The goal of NDI is to broaden awareness of the Library’s innovation and grow the use of its digital resources through outreach and external partnerships. How we do this is an exciting work-in-progress and our presentation will serve as a progress report and invitation to engage with us as we seek to broaden awareness of the Library of Congress’s advances and explore potential uses of our digital resources. 

The presentation will focus on steps taken to advance three strategic goals: 
1)	Expand the use of Library’s digital resources through more visitors, innovative uses and new audiences
2)	Promote the Library as a digital innovator by acting as a facilitator or incubator for innovative projects
3)	Grow the national capacity for cultural memory by working effectively with the cultural community.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2016--1300:00,,0,,,,,,

katherine@educopia.org",,,0,"Ten years ago, the landscape of  working digital preservation solutions and/or networks was sparsely populated. Today, there is an increasing variety of DP approaches and solutions to choose from. Institutions can outsource the preservation of their digital content to private companies that are active in the library, archives, and museum (LAM) market space. They can take advantage of cloud services such as DuraCloud, Amazon Glacier, or Google Nearline. Additionally, academic institutions may join membership networks such as the Digital Preservation Network (DPN) or Academic Preservation Trust (APTrust). Or they can form other types of associations based on geographic proximity, institution type, or some other shared characteristic or concern.

One approach that has proven successful over time is the Private LOCKSS Network, or PLN. Originally developed at Stanford University in the late 1990s to preserve e-publisher content, LOCKSS has continually demonstrated its ability to be a stable and reliable preservation solution for locally produced digital content as well. Starting with the first Private LOCKSS Network—the MetaArchive Cooperative, in 2004—PLNs have spread throughout the United States, Canada, Latin America, and Europe. There are currently at least 15 PLNs around the world, including networks in Belgium, Brazil, Germany, Italy, and the UK.

Since they are entirely community-designed, community-run, and community-oriented, PLNs represent community-based digital preservation in an especially pure and direct form. This means that they are especially well-suited to building communities of practice—not only for relatively well-resourced institutions such as large research universities, but also for less-well-resourced institutions such as small colleges, middle-tier universities, public libraries, and institutions that serve historically underrepresented or marginalized communities (e.g. HBCUs in the United States).

This panel consists of representatives from four geographically and administratively diverse PLNs: the MetaArchive Cooperative, an international PLN with members in the United States, Brazil, and Spain; the Alabama Digital Preservation Network (ADPNet), a statewide PLN serving a diverse set of institutions in an economically challenged state; the Council of Prairie and Pacific University Libraries (COPPUL) PLN, a PLN serving academic libraries in western Canada; and Indiana Digital Preservation (InDiPres), a new statewide collaborative within the MetaArchive Cooperative. The panelists will address a number of questions that have a direct bearing on building communities of practice, including membership (recruiting a diverse group of institutions from different parts of the LAM neighborhood), workflow (keeping it as simple as possible while incorporating new tools and techniques), technical infrastructure and technical expertise (developing it collaboratively and sharing it throughout the network), equitable financial management (making membership and participation affordable for less-well-resourced institutions while using membership monies to build the network), and shared governance (e.g. through rotating representation on the networks’ governing bodies). The goal of the panel is to present a comprehensive picture of how one DP community of practice has been working in (ahem) practice for over a decade.

Emergent external services developed by publishers and agencies promise to make licensed materials more accessible to users wanting to perform TDM, such as the CrossRef API,  and the Elsevier and Springer APIs. For every researcher who comes to the library for help, there are doubtless numerous others who find their own way to accessing the materials they need.

The Digital Preservation Network was envisioned four years ago as a dark archive built on the excess capacity of existing repositories with services jointly developed to create a heterogeneous network in order to preserve digital assets of the academy for the long-term.  Supported by legal agreements ensuring succession rights that are signed at the time of deposit, DPN members can confidently deposit digital assets with the assurance they will be protected against technological failure, natural disaster, and institutional failure. 

DPN has been jointly developed by teams from Stanford Digital Repository, Chronopolis (Univ of California San Diego), Academic Preservation Trust (Univ of VA), HathiTrust Digital Library (Univ of MI) and the Texas Preservation Node (Univ of Texas at Austin, the Texas Digital Library, and the Texas Advanced Computing Center).  Each participating repository draws upon their strengths to contribute varying services and solutions toward an overall solution.  Each repository participating as a DPN Node has a set of services that they offer that are different from DPN services and provide different solutions for their member institutions.  The challenge is to find ways for the partners to contribute in ways that support their individual service offerings, don’t create competing and confusing solutions, and fit together as part of a larger ecosystem in order to best meet community needs.

This panel will discuss the challenges and opportunities that come with building a digital preservation ecosystem at scale. Representatives from the partner repositories will describe their repository’s services and how they relate to DPN services.  A facilitated discussion with the community will seek to uncover barriers to participation from the community and discuss potential solutions that would enable a wide range of libraries to be able to contribute their content.

What kinds of services are lacking that the community needs in order to meet the most difficult digital preservation challenges?  How does an institution navigate the plethora of available choices in order to find the right solutions to best meet their needs?  How do we build out this ecosystem in a way that provides the right services to the community at a price that is both affordable and that will support the preservation of the content over the long-term?

The community has been working on developing various solutions for many years.

While many librarians express significant interest in the digital humanities, many perceive a gap between their interest and self-identification as DH practitioners. Librarians often understand this gap to be a primarily technical hurdle, thinking they need to learn to code or become familiar with a list of tools. This techno-solutionism is often amplified by a service-solutionism, in which service roles are seen as an endpoint, determining and constraining practice and interaction. In contrast, we argue that digital humanities is fundamentally based upon socially-constructed expertise and functions more through conversation and relationships than technical skill and services. In this view, becoming a practitioner of digital humanities can be seen as the development of capability within a framework of membership and identity; it is a ""learning to be"" problem. Fortunately, we find this exact challenge addressed in educational theories on situated learning; these theories are particularly useful for understanding the practice of DH in a way that respects the complexity of roles and identities specific to work in libraries. To complement our learning theory approach, we also present a sociotechnical and infrastructural perspective to understand relationships librarians might have with tools and technology. While we cannot ignore how technology shapes practice, we must avoid overly-deterministic reliance on tools-as-solutions. We foreground the dynamics of expertise, intellectual labor, and the visibility of work when considering a sociotechnical-relational model for practicing digital humanities in the library.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2016--1300:00,,0,,,,,,

Beyond these technical issues, digital preservation is concerned with organization’s ability to “display, retrieve, and use digital material in the face of rapidly changing technological and organizational infrastructures”. It is thus best characterized as a larger effort involving a wide range of organizational activities. Even when participating in one or more digital preservation networks, organizations must develop their own programs that integrate a wide variety of local policies and procedures, tools, services, and expertise. As a result, there is often a tension between membership-based digital preservation network services—which tend to focus on technology—and the readiness of individual network members to undertake digital preservation, which involves identifying, selecting, managing, storing, and provide access to digital resources. This tension has created what some have called an ‘adoption gap,’ where even the best-resourced networks are composed of individual members that, more often than not, find it challenging to use these services to their full potential. The goal of this working session is to bring together key stakeholders and other practitioners in digital preservation to discuss the challenges—organizational, technical, and financial—faced by digital preservation network members in effectively utilizing network services, and to identify appropriate member services to help build the individual institutional capacity necessary to address these challenges.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2016--1300:00,,0,,

Building from this maturity, AVPreserve, working with the University of Kentucky Libraries’ Louie B. Nunn Center, turned its attention to the acquisition of contemporary digital content. We saw the need for a tool that reached beyond the archive that could be used to engage records creators and communities in the activity of preparing and sending digital content to the archive directly. 

One of the main drivers behind the project to build this tool, which we call Exactly, was to put it in the hands of donors to enable them to help archivists by preparing their content for acquisition by the archive. The other central driver is that there is simply not enough time for archives and libraries to acquire everything by hand. Because of the growing mountain of digital content, we wanted to start building tools that can incorporate preservation techniques to ensure accurate documentation and acquisition, while simultaneously enlisting the help of the content creators and communities themselves.

Exactly, is a free and open-source desktop application that can be used by librarians and archivists as part of their suite of tools during acquisition.

For some graduates, lives as missionaries in far off places including China was the way that they attempted to improve the world. From the early 1900s until the Japanese Invasion of China in 1937, Grinnell graduates embarked on an educational mission, Grinnell-in-China, based out of Techow in the Shandong province in China. The papers, photos, and journals of several of these people and their families have been deposited with the Grinnell College Archives, where they have been available to students and faculty of the College, as well as other researchers. Unfortunately, few inside and outside of the College were aware of this rich repository. In the fall of 2016, Matthew Johnson, Associate Professor History, applied for and was awarded an internal grant to support a collaborative digital scholarship project consisting of himself, a team of undergraduate students, faculty and staff from the library, and digital liberal arts staff to evaluate the College's archival holdings, catalog and create metadata for them, and digitize these materials. Digitized content would be stored on Digital Grinnell (DG), the campus' Islandora based digital institutional repository. Ultimately, the materials from the Grinnell-in-China archive would be available for all researchers interested in early twentieth century American-Sino relations, including future Grinnell undergraduates who could use these primary sources in their research and to support designing Omeka exhibitions.

Over the course of two years, from 2016-2018, this team of digital scholars and researchers have begun the work of exploring the archives, cataloging them, digitizing the materials, and populating the collection in DG. Most notably, the bulk of this project is being done by undergraduate students, not professors, archivists, or digital scholars. Students are working with guidance from the faculty member; direct supervision from the Special Collections and Archives staff; and consultation with the metadata librarian; the Director of the Digital Liberal Arts Collaborative; and the Digital Library Applications Developer. However, this project was conceived of as an opportunity for undergraduate students to do the sort of advanced research typically only available at the graduate school level. They were to choose materials that would allow them and future researchers to create narratives. Working directly with the originals and considering the existing organization of the physical materials, they imagine how they might be brought into new relationships to explore questions, highlight common themes, and look at historical figures and events through the eyes of these strangers.

Our panel will discuss the results of the first year of this project: what we did, what we learned, how we benefited from this collaboration, and how we envision moving forward in supporting our slowly building digital scholarship activities.

The value of news content in scholarly research has made it one of the most popular sources of primary and secondary resources in modern memory institutions. Libraries, archives, historical societies and museums have a long-standing tradition of collecting, preserving and providing access to the articles, photographs, illustrations, advertisements and graphic design of journalistic output from publishers large and small. This tradition has faltered as the production medium has shifted from print to digital. For the first time in centuries, we have a dangerously incomplete record of events and perspectives—of the news stories that not only chronicle, but also influence, events and the public’s reaction to them as they unfold.


Unlike the physical newspapers of the past, which have been acquired and held by a range of dedicated memory institutions, the vast majority of today’s born-digital news is not being collected. As journalism has shifted from paper to “digital first” environments, memory institutions have remained focused on paper and/or pre-print PDF files of the paper. The live feeds, regularly updated stories, video imagery, reader responses and other features that have radically altered our experience of news stories – from the epidemic of mass shootings to the legalization of same-sex unions – are not collected, preserved or made accessible to readers, not because libraries, archives, historical societies and museums do not want to collect this material, but because they do not know how to collect it, have limited or no access to such content and in many cases have not yet thought about collecting it.


In our still-emerging digital information environments, we lack a national strategy for saving online news. Looking at online news channels in particular, how can we identify and advance workable objectives that help draft and manifest that blueprint? What roles might various stakeholders—technologists and journalists, press association directors and publishers, librarians and archivists, commercial content management system providers and researchers—play in order to ensure the longevity of this crucial digital historical record? What opportunities exist for cross-sector cooperative projects that can provide useful examples for other stakeholders to follow?
 
These are the questions tackled at Dodging the Memory Hole 2016, where stakeholders from across the spectrum gathered and accomplished six goals: 1) produce and publish an outline for a proposed national agenda for preserving born-digital news online; 2) identify concrete roles for each stakeholder community required to accomplish this agenda; 3) facilitate cooperation and knowledge sharing between news technologists and digital preservation experts; 4) examine how technology platforms such as content management systems (CMSs) can be adapted to work with existing digital preservation infrastructure; 5) better prepare students, especially those in library science, archival and museum studies and information sciences for the digital preservation needs of 21st Century journalism; and 6) identify specific fundable projects that will advance online preservation practice today.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,"Dodging the Memory Hole 2016 received IMLS funding less than a month ago.

In addition to the webinars, CLIR is also curating other useful resources of interest to custodians of hidden collections at any project stage or level of expertise. This lightning talk will describe CLIR's development of the series and invite interested DLF participants to join in ongoing conversations about describing hidden collections.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,"If deemed suitable for the program, Project coordinator Joy Banks would deliver the lightning talk.",,,,2016--1300:00,,0,,,,,,

By adapting the mentor model from tech incubators, digital scholarship incubators assemble a team of experts (researchers, librarians, and/or administrators) to work with a PI or project team. Over time this can create a cohort of colleagues that facilitates a supra-disciplinary digital fellow culture. Incubators provide an environment where researchers engage for a set amount of time with digital scholarship experts in order to develop prototypes and workflows. There is a shared expectation that the collaboration will result in demonstrable outcomes--for both researchers and incubator leaders--increased capacities, a larger base of community knowledge and support, and participants' commitment to parlaying the benefits of their experience in support of others' work.  

Our session will be a team-led, audience-driven discussion of incubators for developing digital projects, knowledge, and institutional culture. Our panel will feature librarians at various stages of incubator implementation at their own institutions. Florida State University will launch PEN and Inc. (Project Enhancement Network and Incubator) in Fall 2016, in conjunction with the launch of a new Digital Humanities M.A. program. UCLA Libraries piloted its Digital Research StartUP Partnership program (https://www.library.ucla.edu/support/research-help/digital-research-start-partnerships-graduate-students-dressup) last summer and, due to the enthusiasms of both facilitators and students, has just received funding for a second iteration of its incubator. The University Libraries at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln has been running its Digital Scholarship Incubator (http://cdrh.unl.edu/digital-scholarship-incubator) since 2014, with the third cohort of graduate student fellows participating in summer 2016. 

Panelists will reflect on outcomes and common themes from their own institutions’ efforts, including why a particular model was chosen, incubator culture and fostering innovation, getting buy-in, staffing, selecting projects, and challenges and opportunities. In advance of the session panelists will contribute materials to a shared toolkit, including handouts with background information, proposals to library administration or external funders, budgets, calls for projects, job descriptions, and other relevant documentation. These toolkits will be made available via a GitHub repository.

5500 MOH reports for London (1848-1972) were digitised in 2012 by the Wellcome Library. The MOH reports were published by the Medical Officers of Health. These reports provided vital statistics and a general statement on the health of the population. Although there were attempts at standardisation, the reports display each MOH’s interest, idiosyncrasies and particular strengths. As these reports are not standardised, creating a geo-coded dataset containing smell related vocabulary is a challenging task. We will present the results of the first phase of our research – textmining and geocoding for non-structured text through creating a novel geoparser. 

For the first time data-mining the OCR’d text of the MOH reports for London will produce models that facilitate new kind of humanities research. Analysing the reports (second phase of the project) tells the intimate narratives of the everyday experiences of 19th and 20th century Londoners through the ‘smellscape’. Furthermore, it enables us to run various comparisons and assess if there are any links to the socio-economic identity of areas in London. 

The MOH smell data will be available via an existing website (http://www.goodcitylife.org/). This has potential benefits of engaging with the public.

Mellon Foundation, to address the needs of manuscripts scholars using digital surrogates.  We identified strong needs for data portability, repository interoperability, and tool modularity for doing real scholarly work. Our project aims to create tools that support these needs. 

A concern is how best to meet the needs of manuscript scholars across disciplines and institutions. Usability testing and interviews revealed the need for robust image viewing and annotation capabilities, collation tools, and data portability.  To ensure that our development decisions are informed by community practice, the project uses generalized and interoperable frameworks and standards that focus on scholars’ knowledge creation rather than tool-learning. 

The project utilizes the emerging IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) standard, which de-silos image stores, allowing scholars to work with manuscripts from different repositories, enabling cross-institutional image and annotation sharing. Using this specification, UTL is integrating modular tools with Omeka, the popular open-source content management system, and building tools to increase portability of data between Omeka, repositories and desktops. The project also uses the  Open/ Web Annotation specification to support data portability for scholarly transcription, translation and annotation.

These initial questions are a starting point for examining how the specific duties and qualifications listed converge or diverge from discussions of DH & libraries in articles and other contexts besides job ads. Exploring these convergences and divergences is significant because librarians are often said to play a key role in facilitating DH research. What does that facilitation mean? How is it distinct from the DH knowledge of the faculty, staff, and students who make use of that library facilitation? What ramifications are there for LIS education?

In collaboration with Reveal Digital, Digital Divide Data, CRRA’s forty-four institutional members, and thirty digitizing partners,  CRRA has developed a cost model and project plan that focuses on five major cost elements including rights clearance, data conversion, hosting and delivery platform, project management and outreach. Unlike most newspaper digitization programs, CNP is not grant-funded, but crowd funded. According to Peggy Glahn, Reveal Digital’s Program Director, the library crowdfunding model “challenges the traditional approach to scholarly publishing. It requires librarians to think more like active investors and publishers and less like consumers.”

Since DPN is truly intended to be a “large-scale digital preservation service that is built to last beyond the life spans of individuals, technological systems, and organizations,” (source: DPN.org) our working group was required to shift our thinking to the most broadly applicable metadata for the very long term. At the same time, the community represented by the DPN membership is diverse and growing with a range of experience levels, infrastructure, staffing, workflows, and long-term needs. The metadata best practices and standards used to describe DPN-deposited content will need to be easily implemented by this diverse membership while also meeting long-term preservation and access needs.

Opting for standards-based recommendations rather than requirements, we developed a metadata use case to guide our work that acknowledges the challenges and goals of DPN member deposits. Recommendations from the working group will be evaluated to assess the effectiveness and ease of implementation by institutions on diverse points of the preservation spectrum.

Five years into a mass digitization program, the Wellcome Library had a growing collection of unique published and archival materials, freely accessible to anyone, without membership restrictions. Yet usage remained disappointingly low, and the user experience was fragmented. 

During this presentation I will share how we reframed the problems of discovery, content creation and user access. Inspired by design trends in museums and other cultural heritage institutions, and backed by a massive set of descriptive catalogue data, I’ll show how user research, followed by four weeks of rapid prototyping, served as a catalyst for rethinking the overall user experience of search and discovery for a hybrid physical/digital library. 

Starting with a deep dive into our library catalogue data, the four prototypes explored specific challenges to presenting a generous interface for digital library collections. In January 2016, we continued iterative development of the prototypes as an alpha site at https://alpha.wellcomelibrary.org. 

The DLF Forum presents a timely opportunity to share where we are in our journey; to demonstrate how our design thinking has caused positive, negative and disruptive change to the way we work; how we have approached the obstacles; and what we’ve learned so far.

Workers on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk—hailing largely from the Global South—process hundreds of thousands of tasks a day, many of which are submitted by Western academic researchers. 

Mechanical Turk and other similar platforms present new opportunities for research at scale by providing cheap access to a globally-distributed labor market. Consequently, the process of hiring a laborer is changing, yet longstanding structures of inequality are reiterating themselves. The design of the platform itself can be dehumanizing and disenfranchising for Mechanical Turk workers, who often face low wages or uncompensated work, and are left without grievance procedures. Furthermore, unlike student employees or other on-site research assistants, the workers of Mechanical Turk derive few fringe benefits such as education, experience, or prestige from their labor. To engage ethically with this new service for distributing research workloads, librarians and researchers must apply a critical view of labor practice and exploitation. 

In this session, librarians will present research and facilitate a discussion on digital labor ethics in the context of academic research.

Our findings indicate that the vast majority of libraries have third-party web tracking installed on their websites with configurations that present a range of privacy issues for users’ activity on member websites. These results prompted two key questions: What is the appropriate level of web tracking for libraries? Are libraries in conflict with our own privacy-protection values by implementing Google Analytics?

First, we will detail how to configure Google Analytics and related tracking software to better protect patron privacy.

With mapping platforms like CartoDB, MapBox, Google My Maps, ESRI Story Maps, developer spaces like GitHub, and visualization tools like Palladio, it has become easier and easier to create simple, effective, and beautiful maps that display all types of information. 

This presentation discusses the development of an online web mapping project focused on murals in Los Angeles. The project emerged during a seminar course when students began using an online archive that contained images with geographic information but no map viewer/interface to explore the data. The project was then adapted to work with other materials within our institution’s collections. The project has multiple points of intervention and addresses current issues about strategies for how to map and share collections. In particular, this presentation proposes that libraries should more freely provide metadata associated with collections in order for students and faculty to remix it to their own needs and specifications. In our example, the aim was to create a lightweight online interface that users can interact with and expand upon rather than a comprehensive online application that simply provided access to a defined collection. In this way we are exploring a new model of providing access to a collection that actively encourages complex interaction, investigation, and community building",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2016--1500:00,,0,,,,,,

Digital scholarship is by nature interdisciplinary and requires expert collaborators to be sustained over time. This creates opportunities for new interdisciplinary models and methods of collaboration between faculty and students and among library and technology experts. Some of the needed expertise may not be resident at our institutions. How do we build collaborative networks that fill in the expertise gaps across our institutions? How do we create the networks that will develop best practices and sustain digital scholarship projects from all sectors?  How do we educate all stakeholders about what it takes to effectively engage digital scholarship? 

The Institute for Liberal Arts Digital Scholarship (ILiADS.org also a member of the DHSI.org training network) is a project-based and team-based week-long summer institute offering focused support for digital scholarship or pedagogy projects. ILiADS offers participants a summer institute where they may develop projects as a team (faculty, student, librarian, technologist, other experts) and also interact with method and technology experts who can further their project goals. ILiADS is designed to build communities of scholars and practitioners who create bridges across liberal arts and larger research institutions. 

Our panel, composed of ILiADS Expert, Coach, Steering Committee and Project Team members, addresses issues of the many levels of sustainability that live between the Liberal Arts pre-conference and the DLF proper.  We will discuss needs for sustainability ranging from the success of projects, to building capacity among constituencies, through to technology infrastructures and sustaining the ILiADS summer institute. 

In 2015, twenty-three liberal arts colleges collaborated to host the first ILiADS summer institute and weekend conference, held at Hamilton College.  We envisioned ILiADS as a gathering of digital scholars, librarians, technologists and students that offered rich opportunities for institutional teams to focus on particular digital projects, while supported by key ILiADS staff.  ILiADS 2015 participants felt the Institute served a unique need, providing a summer institute week for teams to focus their collective attention on their digital project and draw upon additional expertise. ILiADS brought together valuable communities of practice in an environment that propelled digital projects forward and inspired new endeavors.  In July 2016, ILiADS is also an entire week dedicated to team-based projects and incorporating two levels of professional support available to the teams:  team Coaches and ILiADS Experts.  Our coaches are talented faculty, librarians, and technologists from liberal arts colleges, each bringing excellent project management and digital project skills to guide their teams.  Coaches are also liaisons between the teams and the ILiADS experts, a cohort of highly talented professionals with deep expertise in particular aspects of digital scholarship, ranging from interface design to metadata, GIS, or text encoding.  Experts have been selected based upon the particular needs of this year’s project teams and come from all sectors of higher education.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,"Dear Program Committee and Chairs,

We debated submitting this proposal to the DLF Liberal Arts Colleges Pre-conference but felt that the sustainability issues we are addressing apply more broadly.  Further, one of our goals in ILiADS is to bridge communities between liberal arts colleges and R1 institutions.

In the course students used digital tools to examine literature and rhetoric related to the 1965 “Watts Uprising.” For their final project students worked with rare Watts materials from the Southern California Library (SCL), a community archive in South Los Angeles. Through digitization and the creation of metadata, students helped the SCL launch its digital library presence. What challenged the students most was the metadata, for its creation raised some difficult questions: How does one describe such materials so that they are more discoverable by people with under represented perspectives? Was the Watts event a “riot” or an “uprising,” or something else entirely? The students’ readings, discussions with SCL staff, and critical examinations of existing controlled vocabularies helped inform their decision-making. 

The way in which The Digital Watts Project used the study of rhetoric and issues of representation to help create a digital library demonstrates the rich relationship between the humanities and librarianship. The class’ work with the SCL and its effort to make rare Watts materials available online demonstrates how digital projects can be as much about community engagement as they can be about scholarship.

We will discuss how the tools have been designed, developed and implemented in specific cultural contexts with particular communities in mind. We also see this workshop as an avenue for signifying the importance and value of connecting applied research communities directly with librarians/scholars/end users. Participants will be introduced to these tools and their use in research and teaching, as well as engaged in discussion about how the design of the tools themselves warrant interpretive investigation.  

This workshop will provide training and guidance for digital humanities librarians, scholars, and practitioners who are interested in learning new methodologies and approaches for working with digital materials.

Mellon grant, we measure its success in many ways: redesigned humanities and social sciences classes that integrate technology to enrich student engagement, community-oriented scholarship that would not have been possible without grant-funded resources, and a thriving cross-institutional community that has grown out of the Bucknell Digital Scholarship Conference. One particularly intriguing measure of success, however, is a unique problem that has arisen during the grant-funded period: the inability to neatly categorize our digital projects under humanities, social science, or STEM research. We consider this a good problem to have, as it serves as evidence that we have exceeded Bucknell’s project goals of facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration and student-faculty research projects using digital technologies.

In this presentation we will demonstrate the ways that Bucknell’s research support has generated a unique research model for liberal arts colleges: one that is centered in the library, rather than in individual academic departments. By taking on the challenge of adopting a science research model for Bucknell’s Mellon-funded internal grants, we have generated truly interdisciplinary results for students and faculty. In this 20-minute presentation, we will outline the challenges of generating a science research model for the humanities, offer suggestions for implementing library-centered scholarship, and consider strategies for sustainability beyond the grant-funded period.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2016--1500:00,,0,,,,,,

However, in order for data to be fully publicly accessible to search, retrieve, and analyze, specialized curatorial actions must be taken to best prepare these data for reuse including quality assurance, file integrity checks, documentation review, metadata creation for discoverability, and file transformations into archival formats. Due to the heterogeneous and multidisciplinary nature of research data generated in our nation's academic institutions, the skills and expertise required to curate data (to prepare, arrange, describe, and test data for optimal reuse) cannot reasonably be provided by a few experts siloed at single institutions. Given limited resources, it is unrealistic to expect that every academic library can hire a data curator for every data type (e.g., GIS, spreadsheet/tabular, statistical/survey, video/audio, computer code) or discipline-specific data set (genomic sequence, chemical spectra, biological image) that one might encounter. Similarly, each type of data curation expertise might only be needed occasionally depending on the disciplinary makeup at each institution. To address this problem, the Data Curation Network project, funded by the Alfred P. Sloan foundation, will conceptualize and develop a “network of expertise” model for U.S. academic libraries to collectively provide data curation services that will enable academic libraries to collectively, and more effectively, curate a wider variety of data types (e.g., discipline, file format, etc.) that expands beyond what any single institution might offer alone. In doing so, we aim to better support researchers faced with a growing number of requirements to openly and ethically share their research data.

The activities of DPWG provide a model for institutions seeking to collaborate to meet digital preservation challenges. This model includes: cultivating shared knowledge and expertise; conducting institutional assessments to evaluate digital preservation requirements and readiness; creating Content Profiles to identify common digital preservation needs; advocating for the value of digital preservation activities to achieve institutional buy-in; assessing and comparing commercial digital preservation tools; pooling resources to maximize purchasing power; and collaboratively implementing digital preservation tools.

Authority control - or the establishment and maintenance of consistent forms of describing concepts - ensures that resources are described accurately and that sources of authority data can be repurposed and linked to, building (and propagating) metadata accuracy across collections, platforms and projects. This panel will focus on authority control efforts at the local, regional, and national level, providing case studies of work at the University of Utah, University of Denver, Cornell University, and the Digital Public Library of America. Panelists will introduce and discuss these case studies as well as authority control planning and implementation strategies, particularly in the context of Linked Open Data, at their own institutions. We hope to facilitate an open discussion on the challenges, opportunities, and current state of authority control in LOD work for digital library platforms in particular. Some of these projects discussed in this panel are included below:

University of Denver - 
The Colorado Local Authorities project will provide a central data repository for names of people and organizations responsible for, or the subject of, collections held by libraries, archives, and museums in Colorado and Wyoming. In addition to serving as a central data repository, it encourages institutions throughout the area to contribute their names to the project, building a larger community of practice around issues of authority control for local history and culture.

University of Utah - 
The Marriott Library completed a pilot project for authority control in digital collections using a combination of vendor-based authority control services and OpenRefine last year. A recently awarded IMLS planning grant will extend this work to other libraries in the region by collaboratively exploring shared options for regional authority control. 

DPLA - 
The Digital Public Library of America aggregates more than 13 million records for digital objects from US 1,900 organizations cultural heritage organizations. Records come to DPLA in multiple formats and from various disciplinary backgrounds, leading to a significantly heterogeneous data. This presentation will discuss DPLA’s efforts to implement a linked data-based reconciliation service for place names in aggregated records. 

Cornell University -
Cornell University has a number of projects focusing on authority control and Linked Open Data. One project is our Vitro (the technology underlying VIVO) Authorities Pilot. This pilot represents an experiment to manage authorities and concepts descriptions, maintenance, and URIs across metadata repositories. Questions not just of maintenance, but LOD authorities modeling and data infrastructure, will be addressed. Another project includes various entity matching efforts underway to capture external URIs in our catalog by using $0’s, into our institutional repository (DSpace), into our SharedShelf instance, and into our Hydra Digital Collections platform. We are also actively exploring new areas of Authorities - such as ‘authorities’ for the concepts of Works - as we move some digital collections to Fedora 4, and PCDM. Part of the motivation for our current efforts is to pilot alternative approaches to authorities for our planned migration of a number of platforms.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2016--1500:00,,0,,,,,,

In part, this can be explained by how closely digital library projects have historically been associated with the rhetoric of innovation and a tendency to prioritize cutting-edge user interfaces. However, as our focus shifts from innovation to maintenance — and as librarians, archivists, researchers and technologists become more aware of embodied labor divisions — there is a growing interest in exploring alternative design and hardware use that could be less burdensome.

One promising idea to emerge from these conversations is ""minimal computing"" or mincomp. Favoring lightweight design and simple structures, mincomp is already celebrated for its potential for environmentally conscious digital practice, and its accessibility for users who have limited internet connectivity and/or who primarily connect to the internet via mobile devices. Furthermore, as Jentery Sayers recently formulated it, mincomp can be ""a design strategy for foregrounding the importance of situation, embodiment + labor."" As a result, libraries may find that mincomp offers attractive solutions to questions about project development, maintenance and preservation as well as global access. This panel will present on mincomp work already in progress at several libraries in North America.

Dawn Childress will discuss the UCLA Digital Library’s efforts to reimagine its technology stack at scale using mincomp practices and will highlight a few cases in which access and infrastructure issues go beyond what mincomp efforts might solve. In these cases, UCLA is exploring a more “adaptive mincomp” that seeks to better understand how information is transmitted/shared within the community in order to develop access models that meet community needs. Similarly, Stewart Varner will discuss work at UNC that draws on the practices and values of mincomp to increase access to digital assets while also simplifying the workflow for library staff.

Building on work that started in the Developing Librarian program at Columbia University, Meredith Levin will present work on a minimal edition of unpublished correspondence at the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York that traces the Anglo-American social networks of elite travelers throughout Europe from the end of the 19th Century through the beginning of the 20th.

Her team’s experiments included using the devices to create web radio stations and program a twitter text-to-voice app as well as a failed attempt to build a mesh-network. These experiments led to great discussions on agency, access, and affordability but, ultimately, the group questioned whether this type of physical computing was minimal after all, and if the term ""minimal computing"" was an oxymoron in itself.

Fedora 4 features include vast improvements in scalability, linked data capabilities, research data support, modularity, ease of use and more. 

The Fedora community is currently in the initial phases of drafting a standards-based application programming interface (API) specification that will result in a stable, independently-versioned Fedora RESTful API.  A Fedora API specification will be a significant milestone for the project and the community enabling a concrete and common understanding of Fedora's role in an institution's infrastructure ecosystem. The goal of this work is to develop a broad consensus for an API specification that will be around for some time. As part of the process community use cases for minimum features that Fedora should support in the API are being documented. One of the goals of the API specification is to clearly define the set of services that the Fedora repository offers to the surrounding ecosystem.

The Fedora community has also pushed forward a number of new features, including an implementation of the W3C WebAccessControl authorization standard and a framework for extending the Fedora API. These features were designed and implemented by community stakeholders with coordination from the Fedora Product Manager and Technical Lead. With no staff developers of its own, the Fedora project has adopted this model of feature development to take advantage of contributions from community stakeholders.

In order to increase adoption of Fedora 4, the Product Manager and Technical Lead have worked with community members to develop an in-depth training program. This program can be adapted to suit half and full day workshops as well as three day intensive training camps. Fedora 4 training covers a wide variety of topics, from basic functionality to advanced features and integrations. The training program has been a resounding success, and may serve as inspiration for other open source training efforts.

For example, among the over 13 million records shared by the Digital Public Library of America, institutions have used more than 100,000 unique statements to describe the copyright and licensing status of works. This means users have no predictable way to understand the copyright information institutions want to share. This panel will discuss the launch and implementation of the rights statements developed by Europeana and DPLA, with support from key experts such as Creative Commons.

The overall goal of standardizing these rights statements is to allow everyone to engage with cultural heritage online by giving institutions simple and standardized terms to summarize the copyright status of works in their collection and how they may be used. Providing this information is essential for those who wish to actively engage with the works they find online. Can they use it in a school report? Print it on a t­shirt? Integrate it into a commercial app? Currently, there is no global approach to rights statements that works for a broad set of institutions. Simplifying the use and application of Rights Statements benefits both contributing organizations, which share their valuable collections online through aggregators such as Europeana and the DPLA, and the people who engage with those collections. This panel will provide an update on DPLA’s implementation of the rights statements.

Institutions are also increasingly seeking to make their public domain collections available in ways that easily permit reuse.

Description
Following the CLAMP model for a new type of hack-a-thon (http://www.clamp-it.org/get-involved/moodle-hackdoc-fest/), the Islandora Consortium Group has begun hosting hack/doc events  -- hackathons and documentation rolled into one terrific event! We have used the hack/doc model as an opportunity for librarians, technologists, and other interested parties to get together, define a project, and then work on that project.  While hackathons bring many groups together, their primary purpose is often coding, but hack/docs allow non-coders to participate much more fully in a highly technical event and coders to participate more closely in the design and documentation process.  In our hack/docs, we have gathered programmers, systems administrators, archivists, librarians, front-end developers, and administrators to analyze and contribute to solving various coding problems and building new functionality.  Our wide variety of perspectives have helped improve user stories, made scoping easier, and allowed new ideas to flow more easily into the coding process.

Learning outcomes
In this workshop, participants will:
1.	Learn what a hack/doc event can do to foster and enhance their coding projects;
2.	Work on role, partner, and problem analysis pairings;
3.	Create worksheets for setup and documentation of such critical features as local resources, problem facets, and platforms;
4.	Think critically about ways in which this type of participatory event can break down possible barriers between organizational groups.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,"Hi all, thank you for considering this!

Activities initiated by individual or small groups of libraries, archives, museums, and similar institutions have laid a strong foundation for 21st century archiving. However, instead of reinforcing a common vision for the future of our information management fields, our efforts have often competed, unintentionally undermining our progress at the field level. So is action enough? Or is there a better way to achieve the system-wide impact we need? 
 
In this session, representatives of successful cross-sector communities and initiatives (e.g., the Library Publishing Coalition, the BitCurator Consortium, the MetaArchive Cooperative, and the Nexus LAM Leadership Training Network) will discuss how prominent theories and methodologies from the social sector are being used to enable cross-sector initiatives to “move the needle” on digital archiving and scholarly communications. 

They will examine particular mechanisms and techniques for bridging a variety of stakeholder groups in order to address “wicked challenges,” or multi-dimensional, system-level problems. They will also discuss the particular roles that key information stakeholders—public, academic, government, non-profit, and commercial—can play in the evolution of information management as these groups work collectively and reciprocally, not just collaboratively. They will use examples of promising cross-sector work underway across the “GLAM” landscape to illustrate both the challenges and the advantages that come with multi-sector stakeholder efforts. 

This session will close with a facilitated discussion regarding the individual, institutional, and sector-based roles and tensions at play today in digital archiving and scholarly communications. We will work to identify what stakeholders are missing from our current conversations and projects, and to plan how each of us might work within our own spheres, broadening our partnerships and using facilitation techniques to ensure that our work makes a difference, not just on an individual or institutional level, but on a field level.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,Thanks for your consideration!

Discovery across resource types is coordinated rather than aggregated in the sense that we do not provide a single global search nor do we aggregate results from difference sources on a single page bento box style.  Rather, patrons begin their searches against the index for a single resource type, e.g. digital collections, viewing search result sets and full record or object displays tuned to the features and behaviors of that type.  Behind the scenes we evaluate search parameters and propagate searches to indexes for other appropriate resource types.  When results from these sidebar searches satisfy relevancy rules, we display in “ad space” sidebars links to these possibly interesting resources, facilitating serendipitous discovery.  This approach to discovery builds on our experience that patrons generally know what kind of resource they are looking for and often are searching for a specific known item, and they generally know where to look if sufficiently clear contextual clues are provided. 

The platform operates against a number of resource indexes and is architected to select the result sets and object players appropriate to each resource type.  Multiple views of a result set or an object can be delivered by plugging in additional players.

In April 2016, Lever Press started accepting project and series proposals. To align with the Press’s uniquely LAC identity, Lever encourages proposals that:
* Exhibit a deep commitment to interdisciplinarity..
* Engage with major social issues facing our communities. Founded on strong moral principles, LACs are the location of important debates about the grand challenges that face our society.
* Blur the traditional lines between “research” and “teaching,” creating resources ideally suited for experiential learning environments.

In this session, we will brainstorm about how Lever Press can amplify the innovative scholarly and pedagogical activity already happening within LACs. How might an open access scholarly press guided by the ideals of LACs help communicate to a global audience the unique contributions, perspective, and experience of faculty and students on your campus?

The BHL supports the democratization of science by making this literature available to users across the globe.

The impact of the BHL on scientific research has not been extensively analyzed. This session will communicate the results of qualitative content and textual analysis of a series of 73 user interviews featured in the BHL blog. The initial user blog featured nine specific questions. Although the later blogs are not presented in this same nine-question structure, the author defined six major areas to analyze within these questions. The six categories the author will address are the following: the type of researcher, how users discovered the BHL, the usage frequency and type, the best features of the site, the features users’ desire in the future, and the impact on the research.  

Although this project is limited in scope, it will begin to pool together many responses to interpret the impact of the BHL on the conduct of biodiversity research. This presentation will inform practitioners on methods and concepts to investigate the impact of their own digital library collections.

To evaluate the plans, we used the University of Minnesota’s recently published Data Management Plan questionnaire. The rubric provided us with a wealth of information, but as we conducted the labor-intensive process of coding the DMPs we discovered that the assessors often had very different interpretations of how to categorize elements. This was primarily an issue of language, which in many ways is a reflection of the wider state of imprecision around data management definitions and practices, both within the libraries and in the field. Overall, the project revealed high-quality information about researchers’ awareness and practices surrounding DMPs.

Not surprising, then, that funders are increasingly encouraging or requiring use of open licenses for digital projects outputs. However, for all their value, open licenses can present some surprising challenges.

The digital library world is getting fairly good at managing third-party rights that might present barriers to digitization of existing collections. But to grant an open license, instead of figuring out if anyone else own rights, we have to be able to establish that rights were effectively transferred to or shared with us. Do we have the rights to grant these rights? Answering this question can require a very different kind of records review.

Open licenses can also present challenges when partnering to create new content. They can create difficulties finding common ground when partners have expectations of revenue generation (although open licenses are not necessarily incompatible with revenue.) More importantly, partners such as indigenous groups from many parts of the world may have important values that are in tension with open distribution. There may also be tension with partners from marginalized groups or other populations with whom cultural memory organizations have a negative and/or exploitative history.

However, given research data management's role in funding requirements, there is a growing need among researchers to improve awareness and advocacy for RDM.  At UC Berkeley, the RDM team has approached this challenge by designing a domain-specific curriculum and outreach program to prepare librarians to provide this support.

This program grew from efforts to deliver general workshops for the library community which left gaps in awareness of subject-specific needs. In response to this gap, the RDM team developed a collaborative, domain-based training plan for librarians that leverages the domain expertise of this group.

In the data gathered to date, librarians reported increased confidence in responding to data-related questions in their domain and averaged a 95% satisfaction rate with the program. The training had a positive impact on relationships and collaboration between the RDM program and the library. Workshops had higher attendance and were more successful in actively engaging participants than any previous outreach effort.

In 2016, we hosted Dr. de La Beaujardiere for a public seminar targeting librarians, key partners and researchers, and a group discussion on NOAA data policies and its infrastructure for researchers. 

The research data events helped raise awareness of Research Data Services led by the Libraries on campus and foster effective conversation between the Libraries and its key partners. This talk will focus on our experience on planning a successful data event, as well as any lessons learned from creating buy-in from various campus partners.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2016--2000:00,,0,,,,,,

Since early 2015, we adapted the New England Collaborative Data Management Curriculum and created a 1.5 hour-long overview workshop in the lecture-and-discussion format. Our first workshop targeting librarians and other campus service providers (including IT & informatics professionals and the Division Sponsored Programs) gave them hands-on experience with evaluating data management plans. As a result, the workshop helped our librarians and other campus service providers develop a common language for data management, and their valuable input helped us revise our workshop. In the following semester, the revised workshop was delivered to faculty, students and researchers, and offered them hands-on experience with writing successful data management plans.  Based on overall feedback on the workshop, questions and concerns raised by researchers around data management and sharing indicated strong unmet needs for data management across campus. 

Our approach to teaching data management for researchers, librarians and other campus service providers not only helped exchange knowledge in data management, but also increased awareness of data management on campus. As a consequence, we received several requests for an in-class presentation on data management and associated consulting queries from faculty.

Outcomes will include a best practices document for digital libraries incorporating transcriptions, image searching, collection analysis techniques and improved connections to museums, archives and other relevant databases. Better functionality for the BHL, based on user needs, will benefit other data systems and library partners such as such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), Digital Public Library of America (DPLA), and Europeana.

The availability of digital surrogates has encouraged the creation of digital projects that facilitate collections management and content delivery. Access to ethnographic archives often presents cultural sensitivity issues given their complicated nature of their content and context of creation. Ethnographic archives are materials comprising unpublished records in diverse formats (i.e., manuscripts, sound recordings, moving images, and photographs) that document the resources, history, and culture of Indigenous communities. As users increasingly access digitized ethnographic materials, more systematic ways to assess the outcomes and impacts of digital access of these types of cultural heritage collections need to be in place. Extant models for impact measurement often only address broad or general areas of concern and are inadequate to meaningfully evaluate the value of access to digitized ethnographic holdings. Digital ethnographic objects, which often retain links to Indigenous source communities, lack any specialized impact and assessment measures that account for the complex political and cultural issues that access to such items entails. This presentation discusses five areas of meaningful impacts—Knowledge, Discourse, Attitudes, Capacity and Policy—that can be used to examine the outcomes of access to and use of digitized ethnographic archives.

As vendors and publishers seek to strategize (read: “monetize”) the provision of collections of plain text content for scholarly use, libraries often negotiate access to already-purchased content on a case-by-case basis. The pathways by which this material gets to users are tortuous and hidden. 

Librarians can generate workflows by which content is available not just to established researchers with a clear scholarly case to make for gaining access to textual data, but by all users with a case to make or not. 

With the idea of promoting exploratory access to text context to all users in mind, Michigan State University Libraries has built tools that provide users direct access to large volumes of text. Using a set of 3 million public domain texts (access contracted with Google), we allow users to build and download their own (more manageable) sub-collections of the whole. We are now building the same functionality for a set of digital collections from Gale (which the library had copies of on a shelf due to previous preservation arrangements) totaling over 600 GB of plain text. 

Giving users the chance to work with so much content, but according to their own interests or whims, allows them to connect with data on their own terms. Dealing with massive corpora is too high a bar for most students wishing to engage with digital research. Libraries can work collaboratively to bring that data within reach.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2016--2300:00,,0,,,,,,

This panel will discuss the work of National Digital Stewardship Residents to create a cohesive cohort and community of practice by using freely available tools on the Internet. NDSR Residents are moving on to positions of influence and so this discussion can be seen as having an impact on the broader digital preservation profession. 

The National Digital Stewardship Residency (NDSR) program places residents in host institutions to work with mentors on digital preservation projects. Funded in 2013 through a memorandum of understanding between the Library of Congress and the Institute of Museum and Library Services, NDSR residents were based in Washington, DC, and later in metropolitan New York and Boston. In the next year the program will include residents dispersed across the country through projects managed by   WGBH with the American Archive of Public Broadcasting; the Philadelphia Museum of Art; and the Biodiversity Heritage Library led by the Ernst Mayr Library of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University.

Washington DC cohorts used blogs, Twitter and Google Groups to support one another and to enhance their residency experiences. Once the program expanded to New York and Boston, residents began using Skype. As residents are distributed more broadly around the country, we anticipate more experimentation to develop a cohesive NDSR community of practice.

Since launch it has become an invaluable resource for the university, local community and researchers nationwide. Unfortunately, DigArch was built using a now obsolete version of the .NET Framework. If the system fails, associations between metadata and image files could be lost and nearly 2,000 reviewed user comments, many from experts in local history, would disappear.

In 2014 the Van Pelt and Opie Library (VPOL) assembled a task force to evaluate potential solutions and recommend a platform that would combine storage and preservation of image files with public access through a branded web portal. Guided by the Digital POWRR (Preserving Objects with Restricted Resources) tool grid, the task force systematically evaluated nearly 20 platforms. In the spring of 2015 the group recommended Preservica. After securing Preservica, choosing a metadata standard, and hiring a web-developer who is playing a key role in implementation, the VPOL is now poised to migrate DigArch. 

With this powerful tool, the Archives looks forward to exciting new directions for digitization projects. Library staff, inspired by the selection and migration process, are developing a digital preservation strategy that will lay the groundwork for future recommendations, plans, policy, and procedures aimed at faithfully preserving and maintaining access to digital resources in library-managed digital tools and services.

Those tools do not report what a repository should with invalid file formats. This talk presents a case study of invalid TIFF files that were rejected by the ingest software for the NYPL digital repository and how they were eventually ingested.

The first challenge was understanding the ingest error. Format validation tools that compared the format to the documented specifications like JHOVE reported that the files were valid and well-formed. Image processing tools like libtiff returned an error. Although the TIFF files were valid according to documentation, they would have been seen as invalid by our designated community if they could not be accessed with their normal tools.

After discovering that the error was caused by a singly improper byte, the next problem was creating a solution. Conservators have a well-developed vocabulary for physical collections, examination, documentation, and minimal intervention. Using these principles, a Python script was written to identify and repair invalid TIFF files from a collection of 200,000 images.

This talk shares the thought process behind repairing the invalid TIFF files and how this process reflects against larger community discussions about format validity, preconditioning, migration vs. emulation, and preservation metadata.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2016--2300:00,,0,,,,,,

Each partner brings a different perspective on stewardship and curatorial practices related to digital preservation. APTrust partners may also require different levels of accountability from their preservation environments. How can a preservation solution meet the often-disparate needs of such a growing community? To investigate these issues, the APTrust has undertaken an exploration of what it means to become a consortial trusted digital repository (TDR). There are several variations of digital preservation metrics that can be used to assess an entity’s “trustworthiness”.  The predominant ones—TRAC, and TDR (based on ISO 16363)—can provide the means to harmonize the various, competing priorities among various partners and provide clear pathways for accountability. Perhaps most importantly, this exploration of digital preservation metrics can, in turn, help each partner articulate and implement solid preservation practices in their home institutions in a way that moves us collectively towards a more standardized practice of stewardship.

This panel represents members of the APTrust TDR Work Group. Each of us is scrutinizing various aspects of TDR status. We will discuss some significant areas of accountability. In particular, we will delve into issues related to:

- Governance (requirements, transparency, reporting)

- Deposit agreements (including preservation rights, IP rights, and descriptive requirements)

- Preservation policies and planning documents

- Security, risk management, and technical requirements

- Budgeting and sustainability

- Other specific areas for discussion will center on vendor relations and the need for transparency in both vendor technical infrastructures as well as security.

The purpose of this panel is to share our current findings but, more importantly, engage the participants in a broader conversation of preservation activities and future direction. Standards such as TRAC and TDR are in a constant state of evolution and will benefit from increased engagement from practitioners and theorists alike.

Using a case study of the development of an ontology for genealogical data, this paper reflects on gaps, erasures, silences, residual categories, and orphans of infrastructure in information systems, particularly for family history. Genealogical practice in the US has been structured by acceptance of biological descent as the primary, natural, and legitimate form of kinship. Family history is the search for the names of biological ancestors in the limited and problematic archival record. Genealogical genetic testing reifies biological kinship, albeit imperfectly. The information infrastructures of genealogy, including the pedigree chart and the family group sheet, impose lineal thinking on the documentation of relationships and kin groups. Non-biological kin making is occluded. However, data structured for the semantic web can allow the identification and naming of other kinds of relationships, and enable the ordering of genealogical data to allow new groupings and kin making to be analyzed and visualized. If events, states, and relationships that striate American history can be foregrounded—including adoption, coverture, slavery, and dispossession—genealogy can be remade as people’s history instead of documentation of elite descent. Nevertheless, enhanced computational access to personal information, particularly in a post-genomic, data-intensive era, poses perils to freedom as well.

While few decision-making tools exist to help guide the procurement process, an institution can begin to prepare itself by assessing its state of readiness using tools like the NDSA’s Levels of Digital Preservation, the Audit and Certification of Trustworthy Repositories (ISO 16363) or the AIDA Self-Assessment Toolkit.

Digital curation activities are evaluated in many ways, and the judgments and decisions of practitioners must be balanced against the priorities of stakeholders including departments, parent institutions, governing bodies, and sponsoring organizations. Practitioners can choose from robust conceptual and practical frameworks to describe the actions they take on their holdings and those holdings' structure and intellectual content. Yet few such frameworks exist for formally articulating the importance of items or collections, or the reasoning behind their care and use. In other words, when describing the things we keep and what we do with them, we have systems for documenting who, what, when, where, and how, but why remains elusive.
To address this need internally, J. Y. Joyner Library at East Carolina University launched FLAVOR, the Framework for Longitudinal Assessment of Value and Operative Rationale. An open-ended project, FLAVOR is a test kitchen for combining new and existing conceptual models, descriptors, schema, and software tools to facilitate shared understanding of assessments and decisions across the Library. As materials move through the information lifecycle, FLAVOR helps establish a common means to describe the bases and reasoning behind administrative, curatorial, preservation, and access decisions.

As with many academic institutions, budgetary support for implementing and maintaining such a project was next to nothing. With patience and a strategic plan, four years later the library has been able to secure a CMS, server space, equipment, production space, and a website that now hosts close to 5,000 digital objects with just under 5TB of server space available for storage.

This presentation discusses the journey in greater detail and outlines some key steps that helped create the digital collections we have today, while emphasizing the limited resources that were available. This includes working with our IT department, investigating open source content management software, identifying important and realistic goals, finding cost-effective approaches to equipment and digitization, working with other stakeholders on campus, and keeping digital preservation a priority and not an afterthought. 

Although budgets are always a reality that often dictate project feasibility, the path that Murphy Library took to ensure both the access and preservation of digital content serves as an example to other similar sized institutions that have the desire and demand for digital collections, but not the immediate resources. With the wide availability of technology, the increased user expectation of digital content, and the general reduction in the cost of storage space, institutions should no longer have to choose between access or preservation of digital content, but be able to offer both.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,"Although this proposal is broad regarding the establishment of a digital program, I would like to emphasize how digital preservation plays as significant a role as access and production.

We worked with the University's Marketing and Communications photography staff to develop a photograph loader, which works in concert with their workflow by allowing photographers to add descriptive metadata directly into the IPTC header of their JPGs while they are doing their photo editing. We worked with University Archives and Special Collections to create a loader that syncs with their digitization workflow. Archives' student workers enter descriptive metadata for a file into a Google Form as its being digitized and subsequently uploaded to the repository. The form generates a spreadsheet, which is reviewed by professional cataloging staff, then is uploaded and matched to the already ingested files.
These ingestion methods were designed by working with our communities to learn about how we can support their work.

What drives our rationale to build? Whose knowledge is represented? Who benefits from their use?  This panel will share a wide range of perspectives that unite ethics and digital library work in order to inform library activity in this space.    

Presenter 1. Humanists have focused considerable energy on developing critical uses of computational methods. Prioritization of methodological resolution comes at the cost of determining how to extend standards of physical object evaluation to digital equivalents. This presentation will translate disciplinary approaches to evaluating object structure, provenance, authenticity, and labor invested in object creation so that they have equal purchase in a digital environment. To articulate a critical data praxis, this ethical imperative must be achieved. 

Presenter 2. In response to universities' exigencies to diversify collection holdings, academic libraries have partnered with local and global communities to preserve and provide access to unique information resources for scholarly use. However, these partnerships should be evaluated critically in order to minimize reproducing the neo/colonial practices that have historically resulted in the unequal distribution of resources between partners. Aiming to foster an ethical community of practice, this presentation draws upon UCLA’s International Digital Ephemera Project’s experiences to discuss the ethical issues and lessons learned from global south collaborations. 

Presenter 3. For making to matter in the humanities, we must focus making in ways that encourage attention to—and advocacy for—the humane. Regardless of whether the act of making is one of production, praxis, theory, or a combination of the three, thoughtful making in the humanities should forefront reflection on human experiences. Purdom Lindblad will share recent work with the Take Back the Archive project and other Scholars’ Lab projects, to explore what it means to make things in humane, empathetic ways. How can we create spaces and foster relationships to focus on humane, empathetic making in the humanities? 

Presenter 4. Ancestral Voices brings together the Passamaquoddy Indian Nation of Maine, Library of Congress, and Local Contexts and Mukurtu CMS to ethically manage and share indigenous cultural heritage and IP in the digital environment.  These workflows will enable the attribution of community cultural history via Traditional Knowledge labels embedded in the repository’s public catalog records of historic collection items.  Respectful co-curation and emergent digital tools ensure that Native people’s cultural knowledge is formative to the annotation and description of the national library’s holdings.

Presenter 5. UT Austin’s LLILAS Benson Latin American Studies and Collections has piloted a collaborative post-custodial approach to preserving and providing access to vulnerable human rights documentation from Latin America. Rather than taking physical custody of collections, the initiative builds local archival and digital capacity while bringing these materials together in an online repository.

Often, the path from idea to prototype becomes clear as researchers work with library staff to refine their goals.  What's sometimes less clear is the path from prototype to production, especially when ""production"" also entails the end of support by library staff.  Messy project transitions sometimes seem unavoidable.

In this lunchtime working session, participants will share experiences with project transitions, identify common challenges, and take concrete steps toward describing some library-focused practices and principles for moving digital projects out of an incubator space and into an external production environment.  We'll ground our discussion in experience, but also consider what larger issues project transitions tend to surface--for example, the need for libraries to be involved in teaching metaliteracy, whether project development should be thought of as a library ""service"" at all, and the extent to which libraries should be in the business of hosting or publishing digital scholarship projects.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2016--2300:00,,0,,,,,,

Fedora 4 builds on this standard to provide a core set functionality generally associated with digital repositories, such as versioning, fixity, messaging, and audit.  API-X builds on LDP and Fedora to provide a framework for binding services to repository objects, exposing services and and their derivatives  as web resources with stable URIs that can be discovered and linked to.  By functioning entirely in the HTTP layer as middleware that routes requests between clients, Fedora, and backend services;  API-X seeks to provide a general-purpose extensibility mechanism that is not specifically tied to any Fedora software implementation.   

As a community effort lead by libraries, universities, and museums that employ fedora-based repository infrastructure, API-X development is driven by use cases common to such institutions.  These use cases include content ingestion (e.g. ingesting the contents of BagIt package into a repository collection), data transformations (e.g expose a URI that returns alternate representations of repository resources), fine-grained access management, and more.  This work is funded in part by an IMLS national leadership grant.

Without an established practice within scholarly communities or explicit guidance from disciplinary style guides, institutional repositories need to help define the scholarly communication system they support. Elsevier’s recent acquisition of the Social Science Research Network (SSRN), coupled with CrossRef’s turn towards assigning DOIs to pre-prints only further highlights the need for libraries to have serious discussions about the role our repositories play in shaping the scholarly record. 

Commercial publishers often frame conversations about versioning, but what would we want this to look like in libraries? As analytics overtake content, does treating a pre-print or post-print as a part of the published manuscript make it more susceptible to enclosure by commercial publishers? How does connecting the pre-print to the publisher’s PDF alter the ways in which the impact of that work and the platform that distributes it are measured?

A significant and necessary task that goes into making NYARC’s archived web collection a valuable scholarly resource is performing meticulous quality assurance (QA) on every crawl. 

As two of this year’s NYARC web archiving fellows, we would like to open ourselves up to the larger digital librarianship community as open books for anyone interested in learning more about the importance of QAing. Performing QA is absolutely vital to the health of an institution’s web archive. The cumbersomeness of performing QA correctly and thoroughly, however, is also a significant barrier to entry for many librarians. 

With our presentation, we hope to share our experiences, struggles, and suggestions to others who want to perform in-depth QA within their web archives. We will first provide an overview of the web archiving field, then present QA best practices and our personal experiences with obstacles, and end with a summary of our discovery initiatives and a call to action to preserve archived web collections.

Abstract:
Our intention with our papers is to talk about a collection that provides diversity and inclusivity in the digital preservation landscape.  In addition, we will discuss the technical challenges in bringing MICHILAC, the MIdwest CHIcano Latino Activist Collection to light.  These challenges include:
•	efforts in identifying and collecting materials from an agricultural migrant community base with a low history of collecting and archiving cultural and historical materials
•	meta-data creation and display in a bilingual database constricted by character presentation
•	scanning and preservation-related challenges of working with materials with limited bibliographic content
•	How is MICHILAC comparable to other Latino digital archival
•	The issues of digitizing cultural heritage items of non-standard formats such as buttons, large scale posters/newspapers, and damaged or incomplete items.
•	How to complete work using a undergraduate work force supervised by library support staff",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2016--2300:00,2016--2300:00,0,,,,,,

After being awarded an Andrew W. Mellon Foundation grant in 2013, NYARC formally began its web archiving program.

As web archiving fellows, we spend the majority of our time performing quality assurance work on archived websites, cataloging their instances, and aiding in the capture of new, digitally-at-risk websites. We assess the behavior/functionality, visual appearance, and embedded content of these sites, ensuring they are captured and viewable with as much fidelity to their live iterations as possible. 

The goal of web archiving (and NYARC as a whole) is to provide access to a wide community. We hope to create a poster that shows some of the issues we have encountered as web archiving interns, such as carousels, issues unique to the Archive-It software, obstacles with live links, and more.

In addition, a variety of local guidelines, two relevant sets of cataloging rules, and a sampling of metadata records “in the wild” are being closely analyzed. This work has revealed extreme variance in practice. One of the challenges will be to bridge the bibliographic and archival approaches to describing archived web content. 

The working group will issue two outputs: a report on user needs will inform community-wide understanding of documented needs and behaviors, and this will serve as evidence to underlie the metadata best practices that will be developed.
