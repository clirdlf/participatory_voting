By looking at the origin and development of institutional repositories through the lens of digital preservation practice, an argument will be made that the IR community needs to move away from locally run infrastructure and consider how best to scale our efforts at the national level, in order to effectively connect to digital preservation processing and distributed storage services that necessarily operate at-scale. By looking at successful at-scale Canadian examples of the pairing of repositories and digital preservation in adjacent domains, we hope to encourage the preservation community to recognize the importance of, and advocate for, a highly- scaled, community-led institutional repository environment that can help academic and research libraries meet their digital preservation goals.

","As Digital Production and Preservation Manager for Stanford University Press’s Mellon-funded digital publishing initiative, I want to tell the story of how we’re preserving the digital scholarly monographs we’re publishing, with the aim of identifying how each of our approaches (web archiving, repository storage, and documentation) reframes a publication’s story.","As part of a Mellon grant to develop a program for the publication of interactive web-based projects, Stanford University Press is employing three methods for persisting projects once they’re published: web archiving, repository storage of code and content, and in-depth documentation of the user experience. In this presentation, I will use the example of a recent SUP publication to demonstrate how each of these approaches privileges a unique version of the story comprising the published work. For example, a web archive preserves the interactive surface of the project, emulating a reader’s engagement with the content, thus foregrounding the polished publication for an audience whose primary interest is the project’s field of study. Alternatively, a repository collection offers access to the story told by the project’s underlying code and platform, serving the interests of researchers of digital architecture or history. Finally, documentation, including narrated screencast and written description of the user experience, removes the technical fragility and non-accessibility of the web archive or repository collection, telling yet another version of the story. While not providing a replicated experience or the raw files for reconstruction, documentation serves as an accessible description, albeit one re-centralizing the author’s voice, for better or worse.

If a digital scholarly monograph, and the arguments it contains, is already itself a story, fraught with implications of author and audience, then its archived iteration is another story. The question is: what voices and audiences are inherently privileged in our approach to preserving these new works?

In this cautious and unpredictable environment it is imperative that leaders communicate with 100 percent authenticity. Boiler-plate responses and memorized copy and paste press releases will not work.,"During the first 15 minutes Shaan Rais will engage the crowd colorfully in vivid descriptions of what true authenticity is and how it translates to effective communication in the workspace. Humorously detailing examples of success and failure through storytelling. The audience will laugh, relate, and let their guard down to learning as rapport is established.

During the second segment of the keynote, 15 minutes will be strategically utilized to personalize authenticity to each leaders’ personal brand. Many people are under the assumption that true authenticity exists separate and apart from their true identity and story. Nothing could be further from the truth. The more of ourselves that we bring into the workspace, the more authentically we communicate. When our direct reports search for inconsistencies there are none to be found. This also offsets any feelings of inauthenticity, undue stress, and cognitive dissonance that occurs from having to leave our proverbial authentic self at the door of the establishment. When people are able to be genuine, honest, and comfortable in their skin in any organization, sentiments of organizational citizenship and loyalty are established. Thus, lowering attrition, heightening retention, and strengthening organizational culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout all levels of the organization.

In the last 15 minute segment of the keynote, Shaan will deliver an authenticity accountability call to action within an Authenticity Development Strategic Action Plan. This ADSAP will come with identifiable challenges, goals/objectives, and desired dates of completion. For the purpose of identifying and rectifying three areas of opportunity to strengthen effective authentic communication. Replete with follow up and coaching opportunities.

This may accomplish the task, but at a cost. Algorithms for data integrity can be optimized for specific purposes to decrease environmental impacts and increase system efficiency. ","Fixity is often practiced as a one-size fits all approach for demonstrating the integrity of data, with preferences for using strong cryptographic algorithms. This may accomplish the task, but at a cost. Algorithms for data integrity can be optimized for specific purposes to decrease environmental impacts and increase system efficiency.","Auditing fixity shouldn’t be done with a blunt hammer, but a toolbox with specific tools for each job. Blunt tools may get the job done, but if over relied upon can have a significant negative environmental impact. It is unnecessary to use cryptographic checksums in every case to demonstrate the integrity of digital content.

Data integrity can be broken down into three types: transactional, authentication, and fixity-at-rest. Each type can use an optimized approach to increase overall sustainability. Transactional fixity checks or checking integrity when files move between storage media and systems, can be securely accomplished with CRC or MD5 checksum algorithms. Authentication fixity checks or proving the file hasn’t changed since it was received over a long time, is well suited for strong cryptographic checksums such as the SHA2 and SHA3 families. Fixity-at-rest approaches may vary upon the infrastructure storing the content with some infrastructure being able to internally achieve and prove fixity-at-rest.

By choosing different approaches for different fixity use cases and decreasing universal reliance on strong cryptography, digital preservation practitioners can achieve the goals of data integrity while reducing CPU cycles and wear-and-tear on storage media, resulting in increased environmental sustainability and system efficiency.

This talk will not address all issues related to demonstrating authenticity but focuses only on data integrity.

Understanding Misinformation: A Lesson Plan Toolkit was built collaboratively by a team of professional library staff and library student employees. It provides instructors who wish to facilitate learning about misinformation with sample learning outcomes, learning activities, assessment tools, and further resources that support lesson plan design. The Toolkit presents misinformation as a systemic issue, and emphasizes that the best way to address it is by building a collaborative learning environment—whether in-person, online, or hybrid -- that gives participants opportunities to reflect, share, and explore together. It is ultimately meant to be generative, and encourages users to adapt and remix the resources provided as well as craft their own learning outcomes according to the needs of their distinct learning communities. The speakers will describe the creation of the Toolkit, and provide a brief demonstration.

This presentation will highlight the newest, most important features of Fedora 6.0 as well explore the mightation tooling created as part of an IMLS Grant focused on lowering barriers to migration.

With a growing need to move into the future, we have focused efforts on incorporating more modern tools to our offering. From cloud infrastructure via S3 and Docker, to fixity and the Fedora API, we will outline all that 6.0 has to offer. We will also demonstrate how all roads to 6.0 are now open thanks to much needed migration tooling and utilities. As part of our post-6.0 development the tech team also released the Camel Tool box which is a suite of microservices that allows integration with Fedora and we will discuss Camel Toolbox use cases and how community need, lead to community shared development of this feature.

Lastly, with no extensive feature roadmap on the horizon, the Fedora community has focused inward on strategic planning for the program’s future. The community began to evaluate the program from all angles and, using the It Takes a Village (ITAV) framework created by teams at LYRASIS, a sub-committee began work on charting a path forward. This presentation will also talk about our work with ITAV and how open source communities can benefit from the insight we have gained throughout the process.

Libraries can use critical digital collections in response. This presentation will focus on an open access digital resource built at Indiana University Bloomington Libraries - Land, Wealth, Liberation: The Making & Unmaking of Black Wealth in the United States - which has seen significant uptake from the campus and community and attracted diverse student workers.

Librarians and students built this resource on a Libraries-hosted digital exhibition service based on Omeka S, which allowed for rapid, collaborative and distributed development, and integration of embedded audiovisual content and interactive timelines. The primary timeline spanning 1820-2020 offers an alternate construction of significant historical periods, tying them to events that directly affected black communities, such as the 1921 destruction of Greenwood, Tulsa, and the federal urban renewal policies initiated by the 1949 Housing Act. Librarians actively engaged students in developing their skills in scholarly communication, open access, and digital methods.

The success of this project opens new doors for collaborative digital scholarship projects between the Libraries, the campus, and the community, and illustrates that digital collections focusing on the stories of historically marginalized groups can be an important means of addressing multiple concerns.

This lightning talk shares one example to tackle the last-mile problem regarding scholarly data tracking and prompts thinking about the last-mile problem.","Efficiently tracking scholarly data (e.g., research funding, publications, citations, patents) is highly important to improve knowledge discovery, to streamline research activity evaluation, and to facilitate research collaboration. Libraries at research institutions can play a key role in the tracking of scholarly data when they provide patrons the access to scholarly information databases (e.g., Dimensions by Digital Science). However, because the needs and skillsets of patrons are diverse across campus, there is often the problem of “the last mile.” That is, the access to valuable data has been provided campus wide, but crucial questions remain regarding how to best use such data to suit specific needs.

This lightning talk offers an opportunity to share one example to tackle the last-mile problem. This talk will introduce how the Carnegie Mellon University Libraries designed and built an interactive dashboard for the Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation. The main function of this dashboard is to quickly find energy experts by searching specific research topics within the Dimensions database. The talk will briefly describe the specific needs, the challenges, and the solutions that are involved in this project.

The target audience of this talk is not limited to Dimensions users, although those practitioners who work with Dimensions per se would find this talk especially relevant. More importantly, this talk aims to prompt thinking about the last-mile problem among the library community, the research community, and institutional leaders. In turn, this project would benefit from audience feedback and potential collaboration opportunities.","Efficiently tracking scholarly data (e.g., research funding, publications, citations, patents) is highly important to improve knowledge discovery, to streamline research activity evaluation, and to facilitate research collaboration.

The unique opportunity of cross-campus collaborative work which centers student labor and ideas provides the mutual benefit of students receiving practical work experience and the digital library benefitting from the most up-to-date best practices they are learning.,"When the Institute for Veterans and Military Families (IVMF) approached the Syracuse University Libraries in 2020, they were looking for guidance on how to create persistent access to original publications and advice on how to curate and make accessible externally created content. Two years later, they launched a digital library that builds on the strengths of the Libraries’ new digital asset management system (Quartex) and runs alongside its institutional repository, SURFACE (Digital Commons), with the end-product itself built and executed primarily by students.

This unique cross-campus collaboration between the Libraries, IVMF, and iSchool has seen students engaged in conversations with IVMF stakeholders on topics including metadata application, collection development, accessibility, and cultural competence. Because the IVMF library occupies a non-traditional library space, students took the lead in demonstrating the value of library best practices to IVMF stakeholders. As the project developed, the Libraries hired one of the graduating students as an embedded digital projects librarian, demonstrating its commitment to both the IVMF and the students.

The importance of this work for digital libraries is reflected in the experience of the students: it is rare to get the practical experience offered by a project of this scope while in library school. Additionally, the creation of long-term partnerships between the Libraries and the IVMF models how digital library principles and practices might be used in other campus collaborations. Finally, the mutual benefit experienced by bringing library students into a nontraditional space emphasizes the importance of library expertise to a broader campus community.","When the Institute for Veterans and Military Families (IVMF) approached the Syracuse University Libraries in 2020, they were looking for guidance on how to create persistent access to original publications and advice on how to curate and make accessible externally created content.

Panelists representing the AAPB and some of the projects mentioned will share insights on: funding and budgets, building and maintaining equitable partnerships, organizing statewide digitization projects, working with vendors, adapting projects during a pandemic, getting buy-in from rural, often under resourced station partners, countering dominant narratives and amplifying unheard voices through online exhibitions of digitized collections, collaborative quality control, copyright review for online access, and community-centered engagement via crowdsourcing transcription and Wikipedia Edit-a-thons. The panelists will also share insights on the need for more funding to support public media preservation.

Through each component, the Museum seeks to expand access to African American history and cultivate broad interest in America’s Black past, genealogy, and culture. Our outreach to African American communities gives voice to the experiences and perspectives of groups that have been underrepresented in the museum, not only in terms of documenting and narrating the stories of institutions, communities and individuals of people of African descent, but also as professionals working in museum spaces, so that descendant communities can better engage with their own histories.

Among the goals of the Smith Center is to facilitate engagement by descendant communities with their own histories across regions of the country, across generations, and across time. As a forum for digital humanities and public history, Community Curation connects black neighborhoods and institutional anchors with NMAAHC and with the nation’s larger historical narrative. Because we support community institutions including local archives and museums to digitize historically significant materials, we help to make photographs, documents and audiovisual materials and the stories they tell more accessible.

By showcasing the Community Curation Program during this session and engaging in a thoughtful conversation with GLAM professionals we can demonstrate effective ways of amplifying diverse voices from neighborhood institutions and strategies for continuing community engagement. We work together to both learn from museum audiences of color and inspire other museum professionals of color.

NMAAHC staff present lessons learned from a rapid response storytelling project. ","Activated by awareness of the disproportionate rates Black Americans were dying of COVID and at the hands of police in 2020, the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) collected stories documenting everyday Americans enduring twin pandemics. NMAAHC staff present lessons learned from a rapid response storytelling project.","Millions have suffered throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, but Black Americans have endured twin pandemics over the past two years. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, both Native and Black Americans are nearly 3 times more likely to be hospitalized and twice as likely to die from COVID-19 than their white counterparts. The killings of Breonna Taylor in Kentucky and George Floyd in Minnesota and many others at the hands of police called attention to the disproportionate rate at which Black Americans are killed by police–according to a 2020 study by researchers at Harvard University, Black people are more than three times as likely to die during a police encounter. The devastating video that captured George Floyd’s final moments galvanized communities across the country and the world who took to the streets in protest throughout the summer of 2020.

The issues facing Black Americans in 2020 were of particular interest to NMAAHC. Museum staff considered the impact these compounded issues had on the Black experience in America as well as the ways in which people in the museum and public history fields could record the rapidly changing situation and capture its affects in real time. Due to the nationwide public health shutdowns, we were limited in terms of how we could engage with the public. So, like many other collecting institutions, NMAAHC pivoted to a digital-first strategy that utilized existing platforms to both contribute to relevant conversations, capture the experience and maintain a high level of engagement with our museum community. One way that NMAAHC was able to meet those goals was by utilizing a story-gathering platform that coincides with a traveling community digitization program to collect and share first-hand accounts of this moment in history.

In June, NMAAHC officially launched the Voices of Resistance and Hope Initiative, which invites the community to upload personal images, reflections and videos about their experiences to our “Community Curation” Platform. Curators, oral historians and other staff collaborated to craft prompts, structure targeted outreach, review submissions and post stories to the platform for public consumption and internal review. Submissions ranged from harrowing tales of surviving COVID-19 to poetic reflections on protest to ways that families stayed connected throughout the pandemic. These stories helped us paint a full, unfiltered picture of how the protests and the pandemic were impacting communities—information that can be used to help inform future exhibitions, research, public programming and other community engagement activities.

In this presentation, we will invite internal collaborators to share their experiences pivoting to a digital-first collection strategy including guiding principles, submission highlights and lessons learned. This interactive presentation will also include pre-recorded interviews with external contributors who shared their stories on our platforms.

We hope that by showcasing the Voices of Resistance and Hope Initiative and engaging in a thoughtful conversation with internal and external collaborators we can amplify diverse voices from the community and seek out ways to continue digital-first community engagement going forward. This session could be of particular interest to those in the digital humanities field as well as those who are involved in social media, public engagement, and digital strategizing roles at institutions.

The killings of Breonna Taylor in Kentucky and George Floyd in Minnesota and many others at the hands of police called attention to the disproportionate rate at which Black Americans are killed by police–according to a 2020 study by researchers at Harvard University, Black people are more than three times as likely to die during a police encounter. The devastating video that captured George Floyd’s final moments galvanized communities across the country and the world who took to the streets in protest throughout the summer of 2020.
The issues facing Black Americans in 2020 were of particular interest to NMAAHC. Museum staff considered the impact these compounded issues had on the Black experience in America as well as the ways in which people in the museum and public history fields could record the rapidly changing situation and capture its affects in real time. Due to the nationwide public health shutdowns, we were limited in terms of how we could engage with the public. So, like many other collecting institutions, NMAAHC pivoted to a digital-first strategy that utilized existing platforms to both contribute to relevant conversations, capture the experience and maintain a high level of engagement with our museum community. One way that NMAAHC was able to meet those goals was by utilizing a story-gathering platform that coincides with a traveling community digitization program to collect and share first-hand accounts of this moment in history.
In June, NMAAHC officially launched the Voices of Resistance and Hope Initiative, which invites the community to upload personal images, reflections and videos about their experiences to our “Community Curation” Platform. Curators, oral historians and other staff collaborated to craft prompts, structure targeted outreach, review submissions and post stories to the platform for public consumption and internal review. Submissions ranged from harrowing tales of surviving COVID-19 to poetic reflections on protest to ways that families stayed connected throughout the pandemic. These stories helped us paint a full, unfiltered picture of how the protests and the pandemic were impacting communities—information that can be used to help inform future exhibitions, research, public programming and other community engagement activities.
In this presentation, we will invite internal collaborators to share their experiences pivoting to a digital-first collection strategy including guiding principles, submission highlights and lessons learned. This interactive presentation will also include pre-recorded interviews with external contributors who shared their stories on our platforms.
We hope that by showcasing the Voices of Resistance and Hope Initiative and engaging in a thoughtful conversation with internal and external collaborators we can amplify diverse voices from the community and seek out ways to continue digital-first community engagement going forward. This session could be of particular interest to those in the digital humanities field as well as those who are involved in social media, public engagement, and digital strategizing roles at institutions.",,,"Winand, Angela",Smithsonian National Museum of African American History,United States of America,North_America, ,WinandA@si.edu,,"WilliamsDK@si.edu, BestebreurtjeML@si.edu, NaviesK@si.edu, WinandA@si.edu","Williams, Doretha;

We call attention to the constructed nature of race in North America and the continuing work needed to imagine race beyond the confines of the established cultural legacy.,"While marginalized as a juvenile medium, comics serve as an archive of our collective experience. Emerging with the modern city and deeply affected by race, class, and gender norms, comics are a means to understand the changes linked to identity and power in the United States. For further investigation, we turn to one such collective archive: the MSU Library Comics Art Collection (CAC), which contains over 300,000 comics and comics artifacts dating as far back as 1840. As noted on the MSU Special Collections’ website, “the focus of the collection is on published work in an effort to present a complete picture of what the American comics readership has seen, especially since the middle of the 20th century.” Given the unique opportunity this collection provides, a community of scholars and practitioners extracted metadata from the CAC to create the Comics as Data North America (CaDNA) dataset with the goal of exploring the production, content, and creative communities linked to comics in North America.

This panel draws on the Comics as Data North America (CaDNA) dataset at Michigan State University to visualize patterns of racial depiction in North American comics from 1890-2018. Our visualization will highlight how comics serve as a visual record of representation and serve as a powerful marker of marginalization central to popular cultural narratives in the United States. By utilizing data visualization to explore the ways we codify and describe identity, we seek to call attention to the constructed nature of race in North America and the continuing work needed to imagine race beyond the confines of the established cultural legacy.

Each presentation in this panel attends to a unique investigation of the CADNA dataset in order to uncover stories of racially minoritized groups and creators embedded or buried within the dataset. The first presentation details the problematic history of subject headings and explores critical issues in representing race both in the catalog and in linked open data. The second presentation considers the potential to understand racial erasure in North American comics. Next, we offer a genre study of subject headings within the dataset to visualize the contributions of Black and other persons of color representation in horror comics. Our final presentation centers a sequence of data visualizations highlighting comics created by Indigenous creators, as well as those that feature Indigenous people. These visualizations offer a glimpse on the dynamic way comic art offer a path to reflect on the complexity of identity in North America. In doing so, we call attention to the constructed nature of race and offer some clarity on the ways our contemporary debates about race and representation are a part of a pattern.

The Science History Institute Center for Oral History (COH) maintains a collection of over 800 oral history interviews dating back to 1979. The interviews reveal the human perspective of modern science, capturing the nuances and complexity of the scientific enterprise. The collection assets, which include transcripts, audio recordings, and research materials generated in association with the interview, were previously cataloged in a microsite. In 2021, the microsite was retired, and oral history collection assets were ingested and cataloged in the Institute’s digital repository.

We will discuss the challenges of preparing and imaging fragile materials under pandemic restrictions, and plans for future community engagement projects.","In 2021, the Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley launched a large-scale digitization project to preserve and provide online access to more than 127,000 pages of California Land Case Files dating from ca. 1852 to 1892. These records tell an important story about the distribution of land, and social and legal justice in California following statehood in 1850, when all Spanish and Mexican land grants holders were required to prove their land claims in court. A lengthy process of litigation followed, which resulted in many early Californians losing their land. The Land Case Files are heavily used by current land owners, genealogists, historians, and environmentalists to understand the land, its uses, and ownership over time.

The digitization project, Land, Wealth and Power: Private Land Claim Cases in California 1852 to 1892 (Mary Elings, Principal Investigator) was awarded a 2019 Digitizing Hidden Special Collections and Archives: Amplifying Unheard Voices grant. We launched the project amid pandemic restrictions and limited on-site work hours. The materials had to be carefully inspected for special handling and digital capture conditions, and many of the materials required conservation to ensure they could be safely digitized. When complete, this project will significantly improve researcher access to the collection online. With over 90% of the documents handwritten, the Bancroft is also exploring community engagement strategies to transcribe and translate the records to extract the full text of these documents to unlock even greater research potential, particularly in areas of digital scholarship.

","In 2021, the Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley launched a large-scale digitization project to preserve and provide online access to more than 127,000 pages of California Land Case Files dating from ca. 1852 to 1892. These records tell an important story about the distribution of land, and social and legal justice in California following statehood in 1850, when all Spanish and Mexican land grants holders were required to prove their land claims in court. A lengthy process of litigation followed, which resulted in many early Californians losing their land. The Land Case Files are heavily used by current land owners, genealogists, historians, and environmentalists to understand the land, its uses, and ownership over time.
The digitization project, Land, Wealth and Power: Private Land Claim Cases in California 1852 to 1892 (Mary Elings, Principal Investigator) was awarded a 2019 Digitizing Hidden Special Collections and Archives: Amplifying Unheard Voices grant. We launched the project amid pandemic restrictions and limited on-site work hours. The materials had to be carefully inspected for special handling and digital capture conditions, and many of the materials required conservation to ensure they could be safely digitized. When complete, this project will significantly improve researcher access to the collection online. With over 90% of the documents handwritten, the Bancroft is also exploring community engagement strategies to transcribe and translate the records to extract the full text of these documents to unlock even greater research potential, particularly in areas of digital scholarship.",,,"Serra, Adrienne","University of California, Berkeley",United States of America,North_America, ,aserra@berkeley.edu,,"aserra@berkeley.edu, melings@berkeley.edu","Serra, Adrienne;
