By looking at the origin and development of institutional repositories through the lens of digital preservation practice, an argument will be made that the IR community needs to move away from locally run infrastructure and consider how best to scale our efforts at the national level, in order to effectively connect to digital preservation processing and distributed storage services that necessarily operate at-scale. By looking at successful at-scale Canadian examples of the pairing of repositories and digital preservation in adjacent domains, we hope to encourage the preservation community to recognize the importance of, and advocate for, a highly- scaled, community-led institutional repository environment that can help academic and research libraries meet their digital preservation goals.

","As Digital Production and Preservation Manager for Stanford University Press’s Mellon-funded digital publishing initiative, I want to tell the story of how we’re preserving the digital scholarly monographs we’re publishing, with the aim of identifying how each of our approaches (web archiving, repository storage, and documentation) reframes a publication’s story.","As part of a Mellon grant to develop a program for the publication of interactive web-based projects, Stanford University Press is employing three methods for persisting projects once they’re published: web archiving, repository storage of code and content, and in-depth documentation of the user experience. In this presentation, I will use the example of a recent SUP publication to demonstrate how each of these approaches privileges a unique version of the story comprising the published work. For example, a web archive preserves the interactive surface of the project, emulating a reader’s engagement with the content, thus foregrounding the polished publication for an audience whose primary interest is the project’s field of study. Alternatively, a repository collection offers access to the story told by the project’s underlying code and platform, serving the interests of researchers of digital architecture or history. Finally, documentation, including narrated screencast and written description of the user experience, removes the technical fragility and non-accessibility of the web archive or repository collection, telling yet another version of the story. While not providing a replicated experience or the raw files for reconstruction, documentation serves as an accessible description, albeit one re-centralizing the author’s voice, for better or worse.

If a digital scholarly monograph, and the arguments it contains, is already itself a story, fraught with implications of author and audience, then its archived iteration is another story. The question is: what voices and audiences are inherently privileged in our approach to preserving these new works?

In this cautious and unpredictable environment it is imperative that leaders communicate with 100 percent authenticity. Boiler-plate responses and memorized copy and paste press releases will not work.,"During the first 15 minutes Shaan Rais will engage the crowd colorfully in vivid descriptions of what true authenticity is and how it translates to effective communication in the workspace. Humorously detailing examples of success and failure through storytelling. The audience will laugh, relate, and let their guard down to learning as rapport is established.

During the second segment of the keynote, 15 minutes will be strategically utilized to personalize authenticity to each leaders’ personal brand. Many people are under the assumption that true authenticity exists separate and apart from their true identity and story. Nothing could be further from the truth. The more of ourselves that we bring into the workspace, the more authentically we communicate. When our direct reports search for inconsistencies there are none to be found. This also offsets any feelings of inauthenticity, undue stress, and cognitive dissonance that occurs from having to leave our proverbial authentic self at the door of the establishment. When people are able to be genuine, honest, and comfortable in their skin in any organization, sentiments of organizational citizenship and loyalty are established. Thus, lowering attrition, heightening retention, and strengthening organizational culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout all levels of the organization.

In the last 15 minute segment of the keynote, Shaan will deliver an authenticity accountability call to action within an Authenticity Development Strategic Action Plan. This ADSAP will come with identifiable challenges, goals/objectives, and desired dates of completion. For the purpose of identifying and rectifying three areas of opportunity to strengthen effective authentic communication. Replete with follow up and coaching opportunities.

This may accomplish the task, but at a cost. Algorithms for data integrity can be optimized for specific purposes to decrease environmental impacts and increase system efficiency. ","Fixity is often practiced as a one-size fits all approach for demonstrating the integrity of data, with preferences for using strong cryptographic algorithms. This may accomplish the task, but at a cost. Algorithms for data integrity can be optimized for specific purposes to decrease environmental impacts and increase system efficiency.","Auditing fixity shouldn’t be done with a blunt hammer, but a toolbox with specific tools for each job. Blunt tools may get the job done, but if over relied upon can have a significant negative environmental impact. It is unnecessary to use cryptographic checksums in every case to demonstrate the integrity of digital content.

Data integrity can be broken down into three types: transactional, authentication, and fixity-at-rest. Each type can use an optimized approach to increase overall sustainability. Transactional fixity checks or checking integrity when files move between storage media and systems, can be securely accomplished with CRC or MD5 checksum algorithms. Authentication fixity checks or proving the file hasn’t changed since it was received over a long time, is well suited for strong cryptographic checksums such as the SHA2 and SHA3 families. Fixity-at-rest approaches may vary upon the infrastructure storing the content with some infrastructure being able to internally achieve and prove fixity-at-rest.

By choosing different approaches for different fixity use cases and decreasing universal reliance on strong cryptography, digital preservation practitioners can achieve the goals of data integrity while reducing CPU cycles and wear-and-tear on storage media, resulting in increased environmental sustainability and system efficiency.

This talk will not address all issues related to demonstrating authenticity but focuses only on data integrity.

Understanding Misinformation: A Lesson Plan Toolkit was built collaboratively by a team of professional library staff and library student employees. It provides instructors who wish to facilitate learning about misinformation with sample learning outcomes, learning activities, assessment tools, and further resources that support lesson plan design. The Toolkit presents misinformation as a systemic issue, and emphasizes that the best way to address it is by building a collaborative learning environment—whether in-person, online, or hybrid -- that gives participants opportunities to reflect, share, and explore together. It is ultimately meant to be generative, and encourages users to adapt and remix the resources provided as well as craft their own learning outcomes according to the needs of their distinct learning communities. The speakers will describe the creation of the Toolkit, and provide a brief demonstration.

This presentation will highlight the newest, most important features of Fedora 6.0 as well explore the mightation tooling created as part of an IMLS Grant focused on lowering barriers to migration.

With a growing need to move into the future, we have focused efforts on incorporating more modern tools to our offering. From cloud infrastructure via S3 and Docker, to fixity and the Fedora API, we will outline all that 6.0 has to offer. We will also demonstrate how all roads to 6.0 are now open thanks to much needed migration tooling and utilities. As part of our post-6.0 development the tech team also released the Camel Tool box which is a suite of microservices that allows integration with Fedora and we will discuss Camel Toolbox use cases and how community need, lead to community shared development of this feature.

Lastly, with no extensive feature roadmap on the horizon, the Fedora community has focused inward on strategic planning for the program’s future. The community began to evaluate the program from all angles and, using the It Takes a Village (ITAV) framework created by teams at LYRASIS, a sub-committee began work on charting a path forward. This presentation will also talk about our work with ITAV and how open source communities can benefit from the insight we have gained throughout the process.

Libraries can use critical digital collections in response. This presentation will focus on an open access digital resource built at Indiana University Bloomington Libraries - Land, Wealth, Liberation: The Making & Unmaking of Black Wealth in the United States - which has seen significant uptake from the campus and community and attracted diverse student workers.

Librarians and students built this resource on a Libraries-hosted digital exhibition service based on Omeka S, which allowed for rapid, collaborative and distributed development, and integration of embedded audiovisual content and interactive timelines. The primary timeline spanning 1820-2020 offers an alternate construction of significant historical periods, tying them to events that directly affected black communities, such as the 1921 destruction of Greenwood, Tulsa, and the federal urban renewal policies initiated by the 1949 Housing Act. Librarians actively engaged students in developing their skills in scholarly communication, open access, and digital methods.

The success of this project opens new doors for collaborative digital scholarship projects between the Libraries, the campus, and the community, and illustrates that digital collections focusing on the stories of historically marginalized groups can be an important means of addressing multiple concerns.

This lightning talk shares one example to tackle the last-mile problem regarding scholarly data tracking and prompts thinking about the last-mile problem.","Efficiently tracking scholarly data (e.g., research funding, publications, citations, patents) is highly important to improve knowledge discovery, to streamline research activity evaluation, and to facilitate research collaboration. Libraries at research institutions can play a key role in the tracking of scholarly data when they provide patrons the access to scholarly information databases (e.g., Dimensions by Digital Science). However, because the needs and skillsets of patrons are diverse across campus, there is often the problem of “the last mile.” That is, the access to valuable data has been provided campus wide, but crucial questions remain regarding how to best use such data to suit specific needs.

This lightning talk offers an opportunity to share one example to tackle the last-mile problem. This talk will introduce how the Carnegie Mellon University Libraries designed and built an interactive dashboard for the Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation. The main function of this dashboard is to quickly find energy experts by searching specific research topics within the Dimensions database. The talk will briefly describe the specific needs, the challenges, and the solutions that are involved in this project.

The target audience of this talk is not limited to Dimensions users, although those practitioners who work with Dimensions per se would find this talk especially relevant. More importantly, this talk aims to prompt thinking about the last-mile problem among the library community, the research community, and institutional leaders. In turn, this project would benefit from audience feedback and potential collaboration opportunities.","Efficiently tracking scholarly data (e.g., research funding, publications, citations, patents) is highly important to improve knowledge discovery, to streamline research activity evaluation, and to facilitate research collaboration.

The unique opportunity of cross-campus collaborative work which centers student labor and ideas provides the mutual benefit of students receiving practical work experience and the digital library benefitting from the most up-to-date best practices they are learning.,"When the Institute for Veterans and Military Families (IVMF) approached the Syracuse University Libraries in 2020, they were looking for guidance on how to create persistent access to original publications and advice on how to curate and make accessible externally created content. Two years later, they launched a digital library that builds on the strengths of the Libraries’ new digital asset management system (Quartex) and runs alongside its institutional repository, SURFACE (Digital Commons), with the end-product itself built and executed primarily by students.

This unique cross-campus collaboration between the Libraries, IVMF, and iSchool has seen students engaged in conversations with IVMF stakeholders on topics including metadata application, collection development, accessibility, and cultural competence. Because the IVMF library occupies a non-traditional library space, students took the lead in demonstrating the value of library best practices to IVMF stakeholders. As the project developed, the Libraries hired one of the graduating students as an embedded digital projects librarian, demonstrating its commitment to both the IVMF and the students.

The importance of this work for digital libraries is reflected in the experience of the students: it is rare to get the practical experience offered by a project of this scope while in library school. Additionally, the creation of long-term partnerships between the Libraries and the IVMF models how digital library principles and practices might be used in other campus collaborations. Finally, the mutual benefit experienced by bringing library students into a nontraditional space emphasizes the importance of library expertise to a broader campus community.","When the Institute for Veterans and Military Families (IVMF) approached the Syracuse University Libraries in 2020, they were looking for guidance on how to create persistent access to original publications and advice on how to curate and make accessible externally created content.

Panelists representing the AAPB and some of the projects mentioned will share insights on: funding and budgets, building and maintaining equitable partnerships, organizing statewide digitization projects, working with vendors, adapting projects during a pandemic, getting buy-in from rural, often under resourced station partners, countering dominant narratives and amplifying unheard voices through online exhibitions of digitized collections, collaborative quality control, copyright review for online access, and community-centered engagement via crowdsourcing transcription and Wikipedia Edit-a-thons. The panelists will also share insights on the need for more funding to support public media preservation.

Through each component, the Museum seeks to expand access to African American history and cultivate broad interest in America’s Black past, genealogy, and culture. Our outreach to African American communities gives voice to the experiences and perspectives of groups that have been underrepresented in the museum, not only in terms of documenting and narrating the stories of institutions, communities and individuals of people of African descent, but also as professionals working in museum spaces, so that descendant communities can better engage with their own histories.

Among the goals of the Smith Center is to facilitate engagement by descendant communities with their own histories across regions of the country, across generations, and across time. As a forum for digital humanities and public history, Community Curation connects black neighborhoods and institutional anchors with NMAAHC and with the nation’s larger historical narrative. Because we support community institutions including local archives and museums to digitize historically significant materials, we help to make photographs, documents and audiovisual materials and the stories they tell more accessible.

By showcasing the Community Curation Program during this session and engaging in a thoughtful conversation with GLAM professionals we can demonstrate effective ways of amplifying diverse voices from neighborhood institutions and strategies for continuing community engagement. We work together to both learn from museum audiences of color and inspire other museum professionals of color.

NMAAHC staff present lessons learned from a rapid response storytelling project. ","Activated by awareness of the disproportionate rates Black Americans were dying of COVID and at the hands of police in 2020, the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) collected stories documenting everyday Americans enduring twin pandemics. NMAAHC staff present lessons learned from a rapid response storytelling project.","Millions have suffered throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, but Black Americans have endured twin pandemics over the past two years. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, both Native and Black Americans are nearly 3 times more likely to be hospitalized and twice as likely to die from COVID-19 than their white counterparts. The killings of Breonna Taylor in Kentucky and George Floyd in Minnesota and many others at the hands of police called attention to the disproportionate rate at which Black Americans are killed by police–according to a 2020 study by researchers at Harvard University, Black people are more than three times as likely to die during a police encounter. The devastating video that captured George Floyd’s final moments galvanized communities across the country and the world who took to the streets in protest throughout the summer of 2020.

The issues facing Black Americans in 2020 were of particular interest to NMAAHC. Museum staff considered the impact these compounded issues had on the Black experience in America as well as the ways in which people in the museum and public history fields could record the rapidly changing situation and capture its affects in real time. Due to the nationwide public health shutdowns, we were limited in terms of how we could engage with the public. So, like many other collecting institutions, NMAAHC pivoted to a digital-first strategy that utilized existing platforms to both contribute to relevant conversations, capture the experience and maintain a high level of engagement with our museum community. One way that NMAAHC was able to meet those goals was by utilizing a story-gathering platform that coincides with a traveling community digitization program to collect and share first-hand accounts of this moment in history.

In June, NMAAHC officially launched the Voices of Resistance and Hope Initiative, which invites the community to upload personal images, reflections and videos about their experiences to our “Community Curation” Platform. Curators, oral historians and other staff collaborated to craft prompts, structure targeted outreach, review submissions and post stories to the platform for public consumption and internal review. Submissions ranged from harrowing tales of surviving COVID-19 to poetic reflections on protest to ways that families stayed connected throughout the pandemic. These stories helped us paint a full, unfiltered picture of how the protests and the pandemic were impacting communities—information that can be used to help inform future exhibitions, research, public programming and other community engagement activities.

In this presentation, we will invite internal collaborators to share their experiences pivoting to a digital-first collection strategy including guiding principles, submission highlights and lessons learned. This interactive presentation will also include pre-recorded interviews with external contributors who shared their stories on our platforms.

We hope that by showcasing the Voices of Resistance and Hope Initiative and engaging in a thoughtful conversation with internal and external collaborators we can amplify diverse voices from the community and seek out ways to continue digital-first community engagement going forward. This session could be of particular interest to those in the digital humanities field as well as those who are involved in social media, public engagement, and digital strategizing roles at institutions.

The killings of Breonna Taylor in Kentucky and George Floyd in Minnesota and many others at the hands of police called attention to the disproportionate rate at which Black Americans are killed by police–according to a 2020 study by researchers at Harvard University, Black people are more than three times as likely to die during a police encounter. The devastating video that captured George Floyd’s final moments galvanized communities across the country and the world who took to the streets in protest throughout the summer of 2020.
The issues facing Black Americans in 2020 were of particular interest to NMAAHC. Museum staff considered the impact these compounded issues had on the Black experience in America as well as the ways in which people in the museum and public history fields could record the rapidly changing situation and capture its affects in real time. Due to the nationwide public health shutdowns, we were limited in terms of how we could engage with the public. So, like many other collecting institutions, NMAAHC pivoted to a digital-first strategy that utilized existing platforms to both contribute to relevant conversations, capture the experience and maintain a high level of engagement with our museum community. One way that NMAAHC was able to meet those goals was by utilizing a story-gathering platform that coincides with a traveling community digitization program to collect and share first-hand accounts of this moment in history.
In June, NMAAHC officially launched the Voices of Resistance and Hope Initiative, which invites the community to upload personal images, reflections and videos about their experiences to our “Community Curation” Platform. Curators, oral historians and other staff collaborated to craft prompts, structure targeted outreach, review submissions and post stories to the platform for public consumption and internal review. Submissions ranged from harrowing tales of surviving COVID-19 to poetic reflections on protest to ways that families stayed connected throughout the pandemic. These stories helped us paint a full, unfiltered picture of how the protests and the pandemic were impacting communities—information that can be used to help inform future exhibitions, research, public programming and other community engagement activities.
In this presentation, we will invite internal collaborators to share their experiences pivoting to a digital-first collection strategy including guiding principles, submission highlights and lessons learned. This interactive presentation will also include pre-recorded interviews with external contributors who shared their stories on our platforms.
We hope that by showcasing the Voices of Resistance and Hope Initiative and engaging in a thoughtful conversation with internal and external collaborators we can amplify diverse voices from the community and seek out ways to continue digital-first community engagement going forward. This session could be of particular interest to those in the digital humanities field as well as those who are involved in social media, public engagement, and digital strategizing roles at institutions.",,,"Winand, Angela",Smithsonian National Museum of African American History,United States of America,North_America, ,WinandA@si.edu,,"WilliamsDK@si.edu, BestebreurtjeML@si.edu, NaviesK@si.edu, WinandA@si.edu","Williams, Doretha;

We call attention to the constructed nature of race in North America and the continuing work needed to imagine race beyond the confines of the established cultural legacy.,"While marginalized as a juvenile medium, comics serve as an archive of our collective experience. Emerging with the modern city and deeply affected by race, class, and gender norms, comics are a means to understand the changes linked to identity and power in the United States. For further investigation, we turn to one such collective archive: the MSU Library Comics Art Collection (CAC), which contains over 300,000 comics and comics artifacts dating as far back as 1840. As noted on the MSU Special Collections’ website, “the focus of the collection is on published work in an effort to present a complete picture of what the American comics readership has seen, especially since the middle of the 20th century.” Given the unique opportunity this collection provides, a community of scholars and practitioners extracted metadata from the CAC to create the Comics as Data North America (CaDNA) dataset with the goal of exploring the production, content, and creative communities linked to comics in North America.

This panel draws on the Comics as Data North America (CaDNA) dataset at Michigan State University to visualize patterns of racial depiction in North American comics from 1890-2018. Our visualization will highlight how comics serve as a visual record of representation and serve as a powerful marker of marginalization central to popular cultural narratives in the United States. By utilizing data visualization to explore the ways we codify and describe identity, we seek to call attention to the constructed nature of race in North America and the continuing work needed to imagine race beyond the confines of the established cultural legacy.

Each presentation in this panel attends to a unique investigation of the CADNA dataset in order to uncover stories of racially minoritized groups and creators embedded or buried within the dataset. The first presentation details the problematic history of subject headings and explores critical issues in representing race both in the catalog and in linked open data. The second presentation considers the potential to understand racial erasure in North American comics. Next, we offer a genre study of subject headings within the dataset to visualize the contributions of Black and other persons of color representation in horror comics. Our final presentation centers a sequence of data visualizations highlighting comics created by Indigenous creators, as well as those that feature Indigenous people. These visualizations offer a glimpse on the dynamic way comic art offer a path to reflect on the complexity of identity in North America. In doing so, we call attention to the constructed nature of race and offer some clarity on the ways our contemporary debates about race and representation are a part of a pattern.

The Science History Institute Center for Oral History (COH) maintains a collection of over 800 oral history interviews dating back to 1979. The interviews reveal the human perspective of modern science, capturing the nuances and complexity of the scientific enterprise. The collection assets, which include transcripts, audio recordings, and research materials generated in association with the interview, were previously cataloged in a microsite. In 2021, the microsite was retired, and oral history collection assets were ingested and cataloged in the Institute’s digital repository.

We will discuss the challenges of preparing and imaging fragile materials under pandemic restrictions, and plans for future community engagement projects.","In 2021, the Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley launched a large-scale digitization project to preserve and provide online access to more than 127,000 pages of California Land Case Files dating from ca. 1852 to 1892. These records tell an important story about the distribution of land, and social and legal justice in California following statehood in 1850, when all Spanish and Mexican land grants holders were required to prove their land claims in court. A lengthy process of litigation followed, which resulted in many early Californians losing their land. The Land Case Files are heavily used by current land owners, genealogists, historians, and environmentalists to understand the land, its uses, and ownership over time.

The digitization project, Land, Wealth and Power: Private Land Claim Cases in California 1852 to 1892 (Mary Elings, Principal Investigator) was awarded a 2019 Digitizing Hidden Special Collections and Archives: Amplifying Unheard Voices grant. We launched the project amid pandemic restrictions and limited on-site work hours. The materials had to be carefully inspected for special handling and digital capture conditions, and many of the materials required conservation to ensure they could be safely digitized.

With over 90% of the documents handwritten, the Bancroft is also exploring community engagement strategies to transcribe and translate the records to extract the full text of these documents to unlock even greater research potential, particularly in areas of digital scholarship.

","In 2021, the Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley launched a large-scale digitization project to preserve and provide online access to more than 127,000 pages of California Land Case Files dating from ca. 1852 to 1892. These records tell an important story about the distribution of land, and social and legal justice in California following statehood in 1850, when all Spanish and Mexican land grants holders were required to prove their land claims in court. A lengthy process of litigation followed, which resulted in many early Californians losing their land. The Land Case Files are heavily used by current land owners, genealogists, historians, and environmentalists to understand the land, its uses, and ownership over time.
The digitization project, Land, Wealth and Power: Private Land Claim Cases in California 1852 to 1892 (Mary Elings, Principal Investigator) was awarded a 2019 Digitizing Hidden Special Collections and Archives: Amplifying Unheard Voices grant. We launched the project amid pandemic restrictions and limited on-site work hours. The materials had to be carefully inspected for special handling and digital capture conditions, and many of the materials required conservation to ensure they could be safely digitized. When complete, this project will significantly improve researcher access to the collection online. With over 90% of the documents handwritten, the Bancroft is also exploring community engagement strategies to transcribe and translate the records to extract the full text of these documents to unlock even greater research potential, particularly in areas of digital scholarship.",,,"Serra, Adrienne","University of California, Berkeley",United States of America,North_America, ,aserra@berkeley.edu,,"aserra@berkeley.edu, melings@berkeley.edu","Serra, Adrienne;

Illustrations of the meanings of ‘hidden’ and ‘accessible’ to be covered by the panel of bibliographic experts and legal professionals include:

• Multi-faceted bibliographic, editorial, and production effort -- Early State Records on microfilm was a hostile resource: few libraries owned the entire collection; state content was dispersed on other states’ reels; published Index headings were too general and often inaccurate; volumes within a title were separated; etc. LLMC and Saint Louis University legal experts contributed significantly to the discoverability of Early State Records. By reengineering our production and editorial workflow, we evaluated every document (840,000 images) on 506 reels of microfilm to inform proper handling. All 2,679 titles received quality citations and invaluable abstracts, addressing research challenges such as languages, handwriting legibility, fire damage to originals, etc. Future plans for enhanced access include transcribing the full text of manuscripts.

• incredible response from the user community-- Once the content started appearing online, it quickly became the most heavily searched collection on LLMC Digital and LLMC Open Access, proving not everything of value has yet been responsibly digitized! Responses following webinars covering this material are impressive as well. For example, NYLI (New York Law Institute), which provides quarterly webinars covering this content for its many attorney members, was the 2nd heaviest user of LLMC Digital in 2021.

• significance of the formerly ‘hidden’ content itself-- Optimized digital access to this incredible collection brings to the forefront information which exceeds expectations. Legal experts have already exposed insight from this noteworthy content in presentations, blogs, and other communications. For instance, several expert blogs written by Professor Joyce Savio Herleth, Saint Louis University School of Law, shed light on the range and relevance of these instructive documents, focusing on timely subjects such as: women’s rights; influences of Indigenous and foreign countries on our history; responses to global pandemics of the past such as smallpox; materials which illustrate black history; and experiences predicated on religion. The list for topics in future communications and educational programs are limitless.

Carnegie Mellon University recently completed a multi-year migration of its digital collections to a new platform. This work was largely completed during the COVID-19 pandemic, which only highlighted the emotional toll that this work can take on developers, metadata creators, and curators.

Urgent action is needed to secure their heritage collections that offer succor, self-definition, and a spirit of community to these oppressed religious and ethno-religious minorities, as well as wisdom and inspiration to the world.

The Antiquities Coalition (AC), a non-profit dedicated to combating the illicit trade in art and artifacts, launched a 2-year project* dedicated to preserving the cultural heritage of minority communities in Iraq through digitization. Beginning in 2020, the AC partnered with three key partner groups in Iraq: the Catholic Diocese of Mosul’s Centre Numérique des Manuscrits Orientaux (CNMO), the Syriac Heritage Museum, and Yazda.

The CNMO was founded by Father Najeeb Michaeel, OP, a Dominican friar of the Priory of Mosul. Working with a team of young internally displaced persons, forced from their ancestral homes by recent conflicts, now Archbishop Najeeb has found and digitized thousands of manuscripts in dozens of collections throughout Iraq. The Syriac Heritage Museum - a state institution located in Erbil, Iraq - is the sole worldwide institution dedicated for the preservation of Syriac culture and heritage of the indigenous Chaldean-Syriac-Assyrian ethno-religious minority of Iraq. Since 2003, especially with ISIS’ occupation of their core areas in 2014, the Chaldean-Syriac-Assyrian people were subjected to culturicide along with genocide. This has emphasized the importance of the Syriac Museum as the only museum in the world that stewards Chaldean-Syriac-Assyrian culture. Yazda is a multi-national Yazidi global organization established in the aftermath of the Yazidi genocide in 2014, to support the Yazidi ethno-religious minority and other vulnerable groups. Yazda aims to prevent future genocides against the Yazidi community and other minorities and to assist them in recovery from the 2014 genocide.

All three organizations have faced similar challenges - minority status in the region, the genocidal attention of the so-called Islamic State, and community dispersal. This partnership was designed to assist all three groups in preserving and protecting their unique identities and cultural heritage materials and making them accessible to community members locally and around the world via documentation, digitization, and accessibility. By describing, documenting, and making records and associated metadata accessible of the tangible and intangible heritage of these communities, the project will protect history and create digital data that sustains them.

The halfway point of this project provides a timely opportunity to discuss challenges and opportunities with the wider digitization community. This panel, made up of a native Iraqi from the Chaldean-Syriac-Assyriac community (Nanno), an early-career practitioner (Arose), and an expert project director (Herdrich), will focus on the case study of this project, presenting first-hand advice from all perspectives, as well as lessons learned about the wider benefits of community-led digitization in Iraq, including advancing social justice, improving community cohesion, and fighting persecution.

In March 2020 the world shut down.

A collaborative environment where people would talk in the hallways became conversations in Slack and on Microsoft Teams. Priorities shifted and relationships that had been planned were shelved. Yet, the problem of re-use and controlling a bevy of digital assets still existed. Lindsay Skay Whitacre of Gutman Library, collaborating with Felipe Estrada-Prada of the Teaching and Learning Lab set forth to tackle this problem by leveraging HGSE’s existing subscription to the Microsoft office suite. As a team we shifted the school culture around creating uniform filenames, corralling digital assets into a central location, and then teaching ourselves to use Microsoft’s PowerApps to design a searchable database that works across HGSE as an interim solution.

This presentation will cover lessons learned (including mistakes and missteps) and the importance of cross-collaboration even when separated. Attendees will walk away with the knowledge of how to take advantage of existing infrastructures and build relationships even while remote. We will talk about copyright, re-use, and the ability to persevere in the face of constantly shifting priorities.

And finally, LC Labs staff will speak to the range of documentation and educational resources that the Library has developed to support public use of its loc.gov JSON API.

This proposal is structured as a panel discussion between various Library of Congress staff members, each of whom have knowledge of separate yet interconnected components of API access to collections. The goal will be to attract a similarly diverse group of practitioners in attendance for additional discussion and feedback on how other digital libraries, museums, or archives provide access to their collections in this way.

This portion of the workshop will particularly draw upon the first two sections of the handbook, “What: Contextualizing digital violence prevention within library work” and “Who: Building community against digital violence.” We’ll collectively engage with two chapters, in particular. First, we’ll facilitate discussion around the chapter “Digital literacy, digital privacy, and digital violence prevention.” Then participants will map out their own potential partners in their campus community as guided by the “Finding partners” chapter.

The bulk of our time will focus on the third section of our handbook, “How: Planning a digital violence prevention event.” We will introduce and guide discussion around the chapter “Planning a trauma-informed event,” and model a workshop based on one of the lesson plans published in the handbook, with participants in the role of learners.

This panel will provide an overview of the Institute of Museum and Library Services-funded National Forum on the Prevention of Cyber Sexual Abuse. Our National Forum project built upon the teachings of social justice activists by intentionally starting small. We focused our resources on fostering a trusting, supportive community of practitioners who shared our values. This took the form of an Advisory Group of survivor advocates who shaped the vision of the project; a Learning Cohort of 34 recruited academic library workers who built a shared understanding around digital violence prevention; and a working group of 10 Learning Cohort members who produced a handbook for use on college and university campuses.

In this panel, we will review lessons learned in the process of planning survivor-centered and trauma-informed programming; primary takeaways from the three-day National Forum; and the structure and content of our handbook for academic library workers, “Digital Literacy Against Digital Violence.” By sharing both our process and outcomes, we hope to inspire attendees to build community to prevent digital violence.

They will share lessons learned about qualitative collections evaluation, metadata mapping, data crosswalk, file storage, and data clean-up processes during the migration.","This panel is composed of the team members from University of South Florida Libraries Digital Collection migration project. The panel discusses the migration project planning, management, and implementation. They will share lessons learned about qualitative collections evaluation, metadata mapping, data crosswalk, file storage, and data clean-up processes during the migration.","Beginning in spring 2021, the University of South Florida Libraries Tampa campus undertook the task of migrating their complete digital collection with over 65,000 digital objects across platforms with significantly different back-end structures. In addition to the technical improvements, the holistic review opened the door to implement conscious editing initiatives to improve the language and discoverability of collections representing diverse populations. This panel discusses the project planning, management and implementation for the process.

An evaluation of the current structure and history of digital collections had to be completed before migration could begin. Collections created in collaboration with faculty and governed by memorandums of understanding required special handling. Training from bepress Consulting Services, online tutorials, and user manuals were all utilized before a small group of collections were selected to migrate as a test. These initial small steps successfully informed local migration manuals and instructional materials before the migration team was expanded.

One of the challenges the team faced was the metadata mapping. The existing metadata for the USF digital collections is very rich in terms of both the data and the metadata schemas as the content of the collection spans a large variety of subjects. The team designed a large-scale metadata mapping application profile for a cluster of collections sharing similar subjects but also checked into individual collections for customization to best maintain the richness of the original metadata.

The team needed a way to migrate content from one repository to the other. With the scale of the contents, it was not feasible to manually migrate items one at a time, so a batch method was devised. The original repository included item level metadata via METS/MODS XML. A script was created to scrape, concatenate, and transform the metadata into the Digital Commons batch upload XML standard. With unique metadata schemas throughout the repository, the batch process needed to be updated and revised on a collection-by-collection basis.

The flexible metadata structure and earlier migrations that have tracked some collections across up to four different platforms over two decades resulted in necessary clean-up efforts to ensure that each XSLT had correctly mapped to the standardized fields. Each collection required review to address the success of the migration, as well as to establish the desired look and feel of the pages. The team took advantage of the migration to review collections and begin cross-linking Digital Collections with Special Collections finding aids and implement conscious editing practices. Progress for the migration was tracked across two platforms. The first was a spreadsheet-based hierarchy to track progress, while the team also used Microsoft Planner to assign tasks at their various levels from creation through clean-up. These systems worked hand-in-hand to monitor the project’s progress, while also seamlessly accommodating fluctuations in the team’s membership.

With the migration on schedule for completion by summer, the team is preparing to launch the new collections, as well as monitor usage and feedbacks for potential improvements.","Beginning in spring 2021, the University of South Florida Libraries Tampa campus undertook the task of migrating their complete digital collection with over 65,000 digital objects across platforms with significantly different back-end structures.

","RIT Archives digitized 61 videotapes that document the ASL literature movement in Rochester. Panelists will share an overview of the history of ASL literature, highlighting digitized materials and access needs for the Deaf and signing communities. Discussion will interrogate what it means for cultural heritage collections to be accessible.","In 2017 through the generous funding of CLIR’s Digitizing Hidden Collections grant program the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) Archives digitized videotapes held in the Deaf Studies, Culture, and History Archives (DSA). These rare videotapes document the ASL literature movement in Rochester from 1970 to 2011 and represent the largest collection of ASL literature to be made broadly accessible. The once “hidden” work of a pioneering and under-represented group is now public, broadening access to the cultural heritage of this diverse group little known outside of the Deaf community and enriching interdisciplinary studies in linguistics, poetry, performing arts, and cinema.

The DSA was established to ensure that the cultural heritage and lives of the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID) and connected Deaf, DeafBlind, DeafDisabled, and hard of hearing communities are preserved. The DSA collects materials that will increase knowledge of the history and culture of NTID and connected Deaf community members, and strengthen identity formation and pride. NTID, one of nine colleges within RIT, played a leading role in the history of the ASL poetry movement in the United States, hosting national conferences on ASL Literature attended by Deaf and hearing scholars, students, interpreters, and the public.

The videotapes capture performances by Deaf poets such as Robert Panara, Clayton Valli, Debbie Rennie, Peter Cook, Ella Mae Lentz, and others performing and analyzing ASL literature works at national conferences, in the classroom, and on stage. Each poet has a unique sign language expressive style, which range from Panara’s transliteration of traditional English works and Shakespeare into contact sign with ASL features, to the avant-garde ASL and spoken English hybrid work of the Deaf and hearing ‘Flying Words’ duo Cook and Lerner, to Valli’s (the Deaf “Robert Frost”) original poetry created solely in ASL that uses body language, rhythm, movement and spatial expression.

Recent studies have shown that adding closed captions and transcripts to videos increase search traffic, page views, search rank, and engagement for all audiences. More than 80% of hearing students as well as Deaf students use captions and transcripts as study aids, enabling them to stay focused, and learn at their own pace which result in higher GPAs, increased comprehension, and retention of content. Making this type of video content truly accessible creates additional expenses. In the case of the videotapes in question, with their unique subject matter and mix of voicing and signing, the difficulties and labor required are compounded.

Panelists will discuss the project from their individual vantage points and roles – a curator and member of the Deaf community, an archivist, and a department administrator. Discussion will center around what goes into making cultural heritage truly accessible; creating best practices that also allow for adoption of sustainable work flow models; and the tension that exists between following best practices and striving to create sustainable work flows and the reality of the labor intensiveness of it all.

In 2021, the Task Force on Membership Engagement and Recruitment was charged with surveying current NDSA members about their thoughts on the value of membership, and their ideas for how NDSA can become more responsive to member needs. The survey was distributed in July 2021, and 31 out of 264 active organizations (12% of the member base) responded to the survey. The final results were written up in a report by the Task Force, and distributed publicly. While participation was below expectations, the survey still provides valuable insight into what NDSA is doing well, and what it needs to improve in order to attract and retain members.

The initial work of the Task Force has shifted to a new Membership Working Group, which is tasked with following up on the recommendations made in the report. One of the recommendations of the Task Force was that NDSA offer further opportunities for members (and potential members) to provide feedback on issues surfaced in the report. We propose a 45 minute semi-structured “listening session,” which will be moderated by members of the WG, and open to all attendees. The WG will provide mechanisms for participants to provide anonymous feedback, and attendees will also have the option to sign up to do a focused discussion with WG members after the conference.

There is currently limited ability for libraries to provide meaningful assurance of privacy for those using library licensed resources given the current state of user tracking.

The Licensing Privacy project, funded by the Mellon Foundation, seeks to use the power of library licensing agreements to effect change in third-party practices, bringing them into alignment with library values of privacy, confidentiality, and respect for user control over their own data. The goal is to develop model license language that would support libraries in advocating for privacy when contracting for services and content.

As a foundation for this work, the Licensing Privacy project contracted with LDH Consulting Services to develop the ""Vendor Contract and Policy Rubric"" to assist libraries in reviewing existing contracts. The rubric presents eight privacy domains and three privacy levels, pegged to the concept of minimal viable privacy. The rubric helps a library identify privacy concerns in a particular contract in order to enter negotiations with the provider with identified pathways for privacy improvements. This hands-on workshop provides training on using the rubric.

Tackling a long-term digital preservation project is no easy task for any organization, regardless of size, sector or resources. Certain resources, such as the NDSA's Levels of Digital Preservation (LoP) matrix or the DPC Digital Preservation Handbook, can help organizations to define their digital preservation programme and evaluate it periodically for improvements.

Nevertheless, dealing with a real project requires much more planning and organization than anticipated. Preservation work begins long before the selection of the system to be used, with the identification and engagement of all parties involved, defining the collections to be worked with, their current volume and scalability for the future, setting goals, e.g., the level of preservation (NDSA LoP) to aim for, and many other things that are only identified once a real digital preservation project is underway.

In this panel, professionals from the US (U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum) and Europe (Oxford University and University of Amsterdam) will share their experiences implementing a preservation project in different types of libraries and archives, by commenting with the digital preservation community the lessons learned during the preparation and execution of the project, what works and what does not, and some useful insights for anyone in the same situation.

Panel Discussion Topics:

The panel will discuss the following topics and questions:

• Key considerations when planning a digital preservation project, including overarching long-term aspects, such as scalability, funding, sustainability, etc.

• Who should be part of the preservation project and what should their role be? Identify the preservation team and the coordination between the different areas involved.

• The methodology used to select what to preserve and what not.

• Peculiarities of each type of content to be considered.

• General insights and future plans envisioned based on lessons learned.

LABDRIVE allows organizations to transition from a siloed approach in which each series of datasets, departments or units is using multiple, disaggregated systems to keep content to a single repository that can adapt to the particularities of each dataset, unifying all content into a single platform.

The platform, resulting from the EU R&D ARCHIVER Project, works for organizations both with a few gigabytes of data, to organizations managing several petabytes. Digital preservation principles are always present, so Data protection comes first. The platform is fully aligned with OAIS, ISO16363, and presents a variety of redundant checks and processes for safeguarding valuable research data.

LABDRIVE is primarily oriented towards research-intensive scientific and academic institutions that need to preserve research projects, working objects as well as associated tools (datasets, software tools, etc.).

With LABDRIVE, R&D organizations can keep the research data they produce for the long term, in a single platform. Researchers can manage their research datasets with the best tools, adopting good practices for digital preservation and also keeping code and data together in one single platform during the lifecycle, independently of functionality, protocols and featured needs.

Despite this, there is yet to be a professional community of practice to help inform and guide understandings of our users’ experiences. As the field moves toward a greater focus on reparative and inclusive description, this work becomes even more essential.

This panel will open with a brief discussion of the panelists’ white paper, “A Call to Action: User Experience & Inclusive Description,” written as a part of Stanford’s 2021 Lighting the Way Working Meeting. The core focus of the session will, however, be an open and collaborative discussion of user experience work currently being done or envisioned by archivists across the profession. The ultimate goal will be to create actionable steps as to how best organize a community of practice around user experience and usability for archival description.

We as prospective panelists recognize that we are coming from a position of work being done at predominantly white and well-resourced institutions. We will approach any discussion generated by this panel and its participants with cultural humility and an eye towards scalability. User experience testing is truly effective when it can be done by a diverse set of archivists with varying backgrounds and from various institutions.

Because descriptive work touches almost all aspects of archival work, this panel seeks to engage with archivists and information professionals from all levels, whether it be those actively involved in descriptive efforts or those who want a better understanding of the impact of user experience work.

Creating such a community of practitioners will allow archivists to center user experience in our work. By doing so, we will be able to make decisions that are based on data rather than assumptions about what our users need. Archival description should be reflective of the communities that are represented in the historical record. User testing can greatly influence this work, especially in regards to current reparative and inclusive description being done surrounding historically marginalized groups. Allowing users to have a voice in our descriptive practices will make for a better and more rounded experience for all.

This interactive panel will explore the creation of a community-driven, transatlantic skills exchange programme between US and UK research libraries which has placed the ‘individual’ and the ‘community’ at the heart of skills development.","The Covid-19 pandemic saw a renewed focus on skills acquisition amongst research and academic libraries. With colleagues working from home, emphasis was placed on the self-acquisition of skills and knowledge. This sudden shift to exclusively online environments and born-digital workflows highlighted the urgency of ongoing professional development for the profession. It also acted as a catalyst for collaboration, which went beyond traditional geographical boundaries, to do things differently, and to make new connections.

This interactive panel will explore a pioneering skills-exchange collaboration between members of the DLF’s Data and Digital Scholarship working group (DDS) and Research Libraries UK’s (RLUK) Digital Scholarship Network (DSN). Inspired by a presentation at the DLF 2020 meeting, this transatlantic skills-development programme has brought together colleagues from over 200 institutions from across the US and UK. The collaboration has taken a ‘community centered’ approach to skills development and exchange, which has placed inclusivity and the needs of the ‘individual’ at the center of its discussions, and a high premium on honesty, integrity, and gratitude. Underpinned and informed by a skills audit of community members, to identify high demand areas for skills, this multifaceted programme has included highly-interactive skills exchange meetings, the creation of a community driven skills exchange directory, and an open source repository of materials.

Importantly, at a time of great stress and upheaval, the programme has placed a heavy emphasis on the ‘human element of skills acquisition’. Meetings have afforded colleagues the time and space to meet one another for the first time, often in small, curated, breakout rooms. Speakers, drawn from across the community, have offered their expertise and experiences through presentations and facilitated discussions, and over 260 offers of skills support have been made by colleagues through a skills exchange directory. Sessions have been recorded and the content of the programme is made freely available on a OSF site (https://osf.io/a59vb/) after each event.

Covid has been a terrible world event, but it has also provided the setting for us to do things differently. This panel will provide an overview of the work to date. Through a series of interactive polls, open questions, and facilitated discussions, it will explore issues of community skills sharing, the importance of serendipity in a virtual environment, and how we can retain the positives of these interactions as we collectively move ‘to a new normal’. It will include ‘remote’ contributions from colleagues in the UK, panelists, and those in the DLF audience, making this panel both international and interactive. Finally, it will use the opportunity of the panel to canvas the opinions of the DLF audience to shape the future of the collaborative programme for the DLF and RLUK communities. Although reflective, this panel will therefore have an important role in shaping the future content of this programme.

This pipeline also supports cross-institutional partnerships, which strengthen a shared knowledge base and extends our community of practice across campus and beyond.

In concert with faculty and information professionals across the institution, the Michigan Library Digital Collections team is reassessing and reevaluating how the legacy of colonialism impacts our digital collections.

In particular, we are examining a digital collection titled “The United States and its Territories,” which holds an array of digitized texts primarily from the period of Spanish and American colonial occupation of the Philippines and other territories. The collection receives a majority of usage from the Philippines itself, with thousands of daily users from the Philippines accessing the collection’s dictionaries, historical texts, and reference materials.

Our team is assessing the metadata quality of this collection, identifying places where the colonial ontologies, terminologies, and perspectives are inhibiting the accessibility and usability of the materials. Our team’s approach combines programmatic assessment with critical textual engagement, utilizing Python scripts to flag potentially outdated, missing, or offensive values within our catalog records to prompt close readings of our texts and drawing upon anti-colonial scholarship and inclusive description frameworks to remediate our metadata. Our project engages with programmatic and reparative approaches to metadata and probes academic libraries’ role within imperial projects.

In this panel, four archivists will present on the process of developing creator-centered digital projects that honor community stories and empower creators to choose how and when their histories are preserved. Presenters will explore topics such as informed consent, agency and intentionality, and their impact as representatives of their institutions. They will also discuss the implications of their creator-centered approach for the acquisition, access, and preservation of digital materials.This panel especially welcomes those who are planning community-focused digital projects.

The My Princeton Oral History Project was created to give power and ownership to students who do not see themselves in Princeton’s history. The project seeks to collect stories left by the wayside in traditional methods of university archival collecting and challenge the traditional idea of ownership of student’s histories, often only seen through the lens of the administration. New oral history training centers student ownership and student-directed narratives and provides a framework for students to interview one another. Students have control over copyright types, authorship and anonymity, access stipulations, and takedowns. Preservation of these born-digital recordings is contingent on student comfort and informed consent, which may be revoked by the students at any point. The students are not obligated to deposit their stories for preservation, and if they do not, our sister personal digital archives program Princeton Preserves! helps students learn how to do their own digital preservation. Our panel will share how we built the oral history project to center the student, linked it to personal digital archives education and support, and intentionally preserve personal histories, whether or not the archives holds them.

The Hindsight 2020: New Haven project was designed to engage the local community in collaborative memory work and preserve a representative record of 2020. Community members contributed reflections via an online platform and through postcards at local libraries and events. Acknowledging that the project asked participants to reflect on ongoing, traumatic events, staff members took a community-centered, trauma-informed approach that prioritized the needs and concerns of potential participants. Respecting the contributor’s story called for a slow, intentional approach where decisions around access, preservation, and outreach were weighed against their potential harm. Decisions included selecting a flexible platform outside Yale’s web environment, making submissions immediately accessible, providing terms of use and access in multiple languages, establishing a takedown policy, allowing for anonymity, and developing a set of values and commitments for staff engaging in this work. This approach sought to shift power away from the institution and towards community members. Presenters will discuss how this approach created challenges as well as opportunities for intentional community-engaged collecting in digital spaces.

One of the largest collections being migrated is the Charles Eisenmann Collection, many of the photographs in which were taken by Charles Eisenmann or his successor Frank Wendt. Comprised mainly of cartes-de-visite and cabinet cards, the portraits are of “freak” performers, people who performed at dime museums or circus and carnival sideshows exhibiting unusual bodily features or skills.

When the migration of this collection’s metadata began, we noticed that the method of description treated the subjects of the photographs as objects, like it described the photos themselves, rather than as complex individuals who were performing a role rather than an identity. The purpose of this presentation is to discuss the remediation of these descriptions, which is still ongoing. Its focus is to deconstruct the legacy information and reconstruct it from an ethic of care in ways that center the individual depicted, rather than portraying them as a medicalized specimen. Names that were included only in transcription or as subject headings have been re-centered in the description as well. Modern community-chosen language is used to displace and contextualize harmful but ultimately relevant language, wherever possible, and the language has been framed in the context of a performed role rather than a self-held identity. The roles are further emphasized by description of the costumes, props, poses, and photographic composition elements that helped to construct the roles the performers were enacting.

As email archiving is still an emerging discipline, practitioners have been working to meet the outstanding need for archives, librarians, and museums to adopt easy-to-implement practices to capture, preserve, render, and distribute email that has continuing value. Yet we know that email has immense future research potential.

In 2022, there will be nine active email archiving programs funded by the EA:BCC program across two rounds of funding. This is a significant milestone in email archiving and the EA:BCC offers a way to trace the course of email archiving email along a continuum from development to a community of practice. This session will highlight three projects awarded funding through the EA:BCC and discuss the connections and opportunities for programs to collaborate and build on existing workflows. The awardees include the University of Maryland “Discovery environments for using email archives: Evaluating user needs with prototype version of EMail COntextualisation DIScovery Tool (EMCODIST)”, the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill “RATOM Functional, Interoperability and Reuse Extensions (RATOM-FIRE)”, and 92nd Street Y “Love the Words: Preserving the Email Collection of 92Y’s Unterberg Poetry Center”.

These projects' combined efforts and outcomes will make significant progress in email archiving adoption, productivity, and efficacy.

Our project launched with months of active planning with partners, but these conversations still did not reveal the full scope of digitization work. Originally, the partners collectively identified 78 codices and 406 fragments and documents as falling within project parameters. After an all-partner meeting and institutional site visits, additional items were identified and others excluded. Currently, we aim to digitize 75 codices and approximately 614 fragments and documents, funding permitted. Despite best efforts to conduct condition assessments prior to digitization, differences among the partner holdings have presented difficulties. Not all codices are the same–binding, size, fragility–and the number of leaves were either initially unknown or under-recorded. While documents are more straightforward, not all are flat (i.e., scrolls) or uniform in size (i.e., papal bulls v. binding fragments). Propping materials for consistent capture with color bars, rulers, clips, and page weights entailed an equal dose of wizardry and physics.

Presenters will review existing outputs and discuss deliverables currently in development.,"This talk will update the Digital Library Federation community on the status of the Digital Content Reuse Assessment Framework Toolkit (D-CRAFT) project. This multi-year IMLS-funded grant project addresses how we measure reuse of digital library collections. While most metrics and assessment methodologies address the use of materials, there remains a gap in approaches and standards for assessing reuse.

The talk will focus on updates for three project deliverables:

1) Ethical Considerations and Guidelines for the Assessment of Use and Reuse of Digital Content (the “Guidelines”), which propose a set of core values, principles, and guidance for the application of this assessment in a manner that accounts for the cares of GLAMR and stakeholder communities and the collections that they steward.

2) Recommended Practices and Tools, which aggregate tools and resources and compile existing strategies for assessing various facets of digital content reuse. The recommended practices address prominent reuse assessment use cases. Additionally, gaps in current assessment capabilities are detailed.

3) Education and Engagement Tools, which will provide examples and templates to demonstrate practical implementation of the recommended assessment practices.

Presenters will introduce the most current iteration of the “Guidelines” and discuss how practitioners can use it to develop more ethical, considerate assessment approaches. Next, they will describe the process they used to generate recommended practices that offer digital library practitioners methods and tools to collect digital library reuse assessment data. The presenters will conclude by outlining engagement and educational tools that are in development for teaching practitioners to use D-CRAFT.

This session will cover the student experience in developing institutional capacity through a two-year project to create 300 3D models to go with the 15,000 digitized insect specimens.","The Virginia Tech Insect Collection (VTEC), founded in 1888, is the oldest and largest entomological collection in Virginia, and a historical collection representing Appalachia’s insect biodiversity. Its more than half-million specimens represent the rich diversity of the eastern United States. VTEC is an exceptional repository of pollinators, endangered and native species, once common but now disappearing due to habitat loss. VTEC was underfunded and hidden from view since discontinuation of state support in 1992. Revitalization began in 2015 with a National Science Foundation grant to fund conservation infrastructure and stabilization through storage upgrades and preliminary digitization for approximately 3% of its holdings. Since VTEC is too large to digitize within the scope of a single Hidden Collections grant, our project focuses on comprehensive digitization of ecologically and economically critical native pollinators, and endangered and threatened species native to Appalachia. This two-year project digitizes, describes, and provides access to 15,000 pinned insect specimens through high resolution photos and 400 high resolution 3D models.

The specialized technical skills necessary for the 3D modeling in this project comes from students in the Creative Technologies program in the Virginia Tech School of Visual Arts. This program trains students in 3D modeling as it is taught in video game design. Graduate students were solicited through a stipend (paid by the grant) and full tuition (paid by the library and the School of Visual Arts) for a graduate degree to qualified applicants. Undergraduate students were also hired as wage employees for production. Students are engaged in technology processes throughout the project and learn complex curatorial tasks, digitization protocols, catalog structure, technical metadata, and documentation. Participation provided the students with a professional portfolio to help them in their search for future employment.

This project also presented the University Libraries’ digital library development, digital imaging, and preservation teams with new technical challenges that are unique across the spectrum of academic libraries. In the absence of firmly established best practices for managing 3D data across disciplines, we developed a technical plan adopted from established reference models such as OAIS, and based on research stemming from the IMLS funded 2018 LIB3DVR project. Entomo-3D presents a real-world test of our findings

In navigating the challenges of the past few years, the students who contributed to the project helped increase capacity at Virginia Tech for future large scale 3D projects, and have also developed a unique and marketable set of skills and experiences.

We will share a project overview, findings from research with archivists and end-users, and discuss how these will inform our vision for the platform.","Aggregation of archival description makes it easier for users to find archival collections and conduct archival research, and easier for many institutions to share their archival description online. Digital aggregations of finding aids (descriptions of archival collections) are often siloed and at-risk as their infrastructure ages and budgets dwindle, and many institutions’ finding aids are not available or easily discoverable online. As a result, much of the stewarded archival content in the United States is essentially invisible, and the voices documented therein are poorly represented in the historical record.

Building a National Archival Finding Aid Network (NAFAN) https://confluence.ucop.edu/display/NAFAN/ is an IMLS-funded collaborative project rooted in the goal of providing inclusive, comprehensive, and persistent access to descriptions of archival collections by building the vision and roadmap for a national finding aid network available to a broad and diverse set of contributors and researchers. The California Digital Library (CDL) is coordinating the project, in collaboration with Chain Bridge Group, OCLC, Shift Collective, and the University of Virginia Library (UVA), and in close partnership with statewide/regional finding aid aggregators and LYRASIS (ArchivesSpace). OCLC Research has conducted extensive research with archivists and archival aggregation users to better understand their needs, in service of shaping the NAFAN vision.

NAFAN reckons with two fundamental challenges inhibiting equitable access to rare and unique collections. First, the significant barriers researchers face in locating relevant archival materials across the vast, distributed, and unevenly supported field of cultural memory institutions. And second, the persistent and fundamental reality for many institutions that their finding aids are not available or easily discoverable online, especially those institutions that are not well-resourced. NAFAN project research reflects on the current state of professional practice and user need.

NAFAN project team members will give a general overview of NAFAN, share findings from project research and discuss how these will inform the vision and roadmap for a national archival discovery platform that is community-driven, -sustained, and -governed. Research activities include a survey of more than 3000 users of archival aggregation websites; one-on-one interviews with academic, professional, genealogy, and avocational researchers; focus group interviews with archivists; and an analysis of more than 145,000 EAD finding aids. ","Aggregation of archival description makes it easier for users to find archival collections and conduct archival research, and easier for many institutions to share their archival description online. Digital aggregations of finding aids (descriptions of archival collections) are often siloed and at-risk as their infrastructure ages and budgets dwindle, and many institutions’ finding aids are not available or easily discoverable online. As a result, much of the stewarded archival content in the United States is essentially invisible, and the voices documented therein are poorly represented in the historical record.
Building a National Archival Finding Aid Network (NAFAN) https://confluence.ucop.edu/display/NAFAN/ is an IMLS-funded collaborative project rooted in the goal of providing inclusive, comprehensive, and persistent access to descriptions of archival collections by building the vision and roadmap for a national finding aid network available to a broad and diverse set of contributors and researchers. The California Digital Library (CDL) is coordinating the project, in collaboration with Chain Bridge Group, OCLC, Shift Collective, and the University of Virginia Library (UVA), and in close partnership with statewide/regional finding aid aggregators and LYRASIS (ArchivesSpace). OCLC Research has conducted extensive research with archivists and archival aggregation users to better understand their needs, in service of shaping the NAFAN vision.
NAFAN reckons with two fundamental challenges inhibiting equitable access to rare and unique collections. First, the significant barriers researchers face in locating relevant archival materials across the vast, distributed, and unevenly supported field of cultural memory institutions. And second, the persistent and fundamental reality for many institutions that their finding aids are not available or easily discoverable online, especially those institutions that are not well-resourced. NAFAN project research reflects on the current state of professional practice and user need.

The creation and fostering of a community of practice to support learners beyond the classroom is key to this effort, going hand-in-hand with increasing access to educational opportunities. In addition to giving learners a way to connect as they work through workshops and/or asynchronous modules, this community is envisioned as a way to support peer connections and interdisciplinary collaboration as individuals from across the university engage in data science and computational research.

UCB Library is working to achieve this sustainably through a shared ILS oversight structure.","Following the successful implementation of Alma and Primo VE in July 2021, UC Berkeley was tasked with reimagining the local ongoing management and coordination of this software suite. The local implementation was just one part of the System-wide ILS (SILS) project; a multi-phase project involving all ten members of the UC system to migrate and then manage a shared ILS, designed to leverage the benefits of distributed management, resources, and expertise.

Currently, UC Berkeley staff participate in both system-wide representative groups and expertise-based teams. Those individuals distribute information to UC Berkeley staff through local teams. The SILS project requires individuals to communicate, advocate, and collaborate with staff across the UCs and between Library divisions at Berkeley simultaneously to transform workflows, optimize configurations, and develop processes.

Following migration, the need for ongoing maintenance and oversight led to the formation of the local Alma/Primo VE Coordination Team (APriCoT) which includes staff from across the Library. Members communicate with local teams, system-wide teams, and supervisors simultaneously in a matrix reporting environment. As part of their membership in APriCoT, they have also been asked to participate in shared decision making, resulting in a shared ILS management structure.

Case studies underscore the value of these materials and set in motion their continued use as interpretive tools in myriad settings physically and digitally.","In 2017 the Asheville Art Museum received 405 documents from the family of Theodore Dreier, a cofounder of Black Mountain College (BMC). Consisting of course catalogs, community bulletins, event programs, letters, essays, and other printed matter personally collected by Dreier while at and following his departure from the college, the scope of materials relates to individuals and events represented within and beyond the Museum’s Collection of BMC artworks. In 2019 the Museum began an intensive period of engagement with the documents after years of registrarial limbo, made possible by support from CLIR’s Digitizing Hidden Collections grant. This process included reorganization of materials, cataloging and digitization, and critical investigation into the documents’ presence within an art museum collection. Processing this collection has been undertaken by curatorial staff, graduate fellows, and interns and has generated compelling examples of how documents enhance exhibitions and object interpretation. This paper explores several projects from the past several years that are precedent for future pursuits. Engagement with the Dreier documents resulted in both physical exhibitions and the development of digital exhibitions and web-based content soon to be available on the CLIR-supported BMC Interconnective Timeline. The documents foster greater interdisciplinarity within exhibitions and programming, bringing audiences into conversations that delve into diversity, design, intersections of media, and ideological impacts that extend the Black Mountain College legacy to the present.

Uncovering CUNY’s Audiovisual Heritage is a two-year project to preserve the diversity of compelling viewpoints that emerged in New York City during the last two decades of the 20th century. Highlights from this era include a never-before-seen recording of Shirley Chisholm speaking at Medgar Evers University and the entirety of HoMoVISIONES, the first tv series from the LGBTQ Latino perspective.

More than just a digitization project, Uncovering CUNY operates in the spirit of collaboration and resource-sharing. Managed by CUNY-TV Archives, digital files are created using the department's magnetic media transfer facilities and preserved in the station's digital repository, eliminating the most expensive barriers to preservation for the archives and libraries in the network. Engaging CUNY-TV's talent and broadcast facilities, the project is presented as a short video on the processes and lessons learned.

This approach is risky: outsourcing a core library function undermines staff expertise in the library and imperils its holdings and resources.,"Decades into developing digital preservation good practices, practitioners face increasing institutional reluctance to invest in future access. Instead, decision-makers are acting unilaterally, selecting proprietary one-size-fits-all technologies that may not align with good practice and cultural heritage values – overlooking the expertise of their own staff. Underfunding local resources results in increased dependence on commercial ventures. As we’ve seen in scholarly publishing, profit-driven entities leverage this dependence to exhort increasing fees which then dominate library budgets, thus leaving even less money available for staff and staff development.

Digital preservation is facilitated by technology, but it’s driven by human decisions and the field itself rapidly evolves and expands in ways that require dexterity. Committing to one system locks us in and makes it difficult, if not impossible, to make those necessary adjustments. Research has shown that deliberately formulating workflows for different sets of content using a variety of technologies, combining good practice with local knowledge, mitigates technical determinism. Our decisions and expertise should dictate the way that technology operates, not the other way around.

As mission-motivated service providers, we are concerned that this approach sets up a dependence on commercial ventures and undermines the mission of the library by outsourcing one of its core functions as information stewards. Despite the increasing evidence that digital content is fragile and ubiquitous, cultural heritage organizations have been slow to respond to the need to safeguard digital heritage materials. Digital preservation staff need advocacy from people with influence in the field so that they can get the training and tools they need to deploy their expertise to make the complex decisions necessary for long term future access. Despite a long history of bad experiences with profit-motivated vendors, libraries and archives continue to make short-term decisions to stay afloat in a competitive marketplace. It is a mistake to think that there is a lack of understanding around digital preservation requirements, implying that if decision-makers just understood it better that they would be able to advocate for our services better. The truth is that the devaluation of and disrespect for labor in our field underlies many of these decisions and lack of advocacy.

Values-driven, community-led initiatives empower and advocate for digital preservation staff in measurable and visible ways, specifically through community governance, community contributions, transparency, and accountability. These services see advocacy as a core value and priority that they share with cultural heritage organizations, understanding that affirming the expertise and needs of the practitioner community is closely entwined with the preservation of cultural heritage. Panelists representing these initiatives will discuss the troubling outsourcing trends that they have seen in digital preservation work, the implications for maintenance and sustainability, what kinds of advocacy are needed, and from whom. To emphasize the importance of conducting these conversations in the open, the panelists will also invite discussion with the audience about sustainability, accountability, and advocacy.","Decades into developing digital preservation good practices, practitioners face increasing institutional reluctance to invest in future access.

In this paper presentation, the authors will discuss the liminal spaces and threshold concepts that they and their team continue to navigate and understand as they develop two types of capacity/perspective: 1) the technical capacity for 3D digitization and model creation, which asked team members to move from amateur photographers to those with an artist’s eye; and 2) the perspective necessary to recognize and challenge the embedded colonial narratives within this collection, which asked team members to move from an individualized understanding of knowledge appropriation to a structural/systemic understanding. By creating a supportive environment where frustration was expected and missteps were constructively, but also frankly discussed, the grant team (including our students) were able to successfully navigate these liminal spaces. By sharing their own experiences, the authors hope to inspire attendees to think critically about the troublesome knowledge within their own digitization projects.

Navigating a system migration, especially to an open source system like Archipelago, is a challenge. This presentation will highlight different approaches three small college libraries have taken to slay the migration dragon.","Open source software offers immense flexibility, yet with great power comes great responsibility. At many small colleges, finding enough in-house time and expertise to implement these systems is a challenge that requires knowledge in many different areas. Systems and application administrators, metadata designers and creators, and project managers all must collaborate with content experts to create a user experience that serves front end users, while also allowing libraries to highlight their diverse digital collections. While the need to connect digital repositories with institutional priorities supported by the repository is constant, it is especially high during a migration.

In order to build support for the migration at our institutions, we followed several strategies, including forming a search committee to evaluate proprietary systems as well as open source systems, and investigating different support models for open source systems ranging from handling the bulk of the migration to emergency tech support only. We also leveraged connections at a consortial group in which we all participated to work with colleagues with a variety of skill sets to do a deep dive into the open source systems we were considering in order to evaluate how each would meet our needs.

While each of our institutions individually settled on Archipelago as its new digital collections platform, we have taken varied hybrid approaches to blending in-house and outsourced work, while balancing pros and cons, and institutional risk tolerance. Outsourcing large portions of the implementation and/or support can be as expensive as subscribing to a vended “Software as a Service” (SaaS) offering, but managing a migration primarily leveraging in-house expertise is not without its own associated costs.

Whether the decision is made to outsource a migration or complete it in-house, there are many steps of the process, from looking at how digital collections are currently used by stakeholders, to identifying which features are the most important, to determining how a digital collection migration can be staged to support intended outcomes. Successfully accomplishing this requires careful planning. Institutions facing a migration should consider the need to create a migration timeline, evaluate the key requirements of both front end and back end users, develop a list of important features, secure a migration budget, and meet with vendors and support contractors of potential systems.

This panel discussion will focus on how each of our institutions approached selecting a new digital collections system, built support for the chosen system (including technical support from colleagues and financial commitments from senior administrators), challenges we have faced on the path to migration, and reasons why we made the decisions we did. Each institution will discuss how and why they chose Archipelago, how they are meeting challenges at their different institutions, and things that they wish they had known before they started their migrations. This session will highlight the importance of pre-planning and project management to guide a successful system migration, and will provide attendees with key takeaways to implement on their quest to slay their own migration dragons.

Using the Debates in DH book series as a starting point, librarians at the Graduate Center, City University of New York (CUNY), along with student researchers are creating a DH project index to serve as a dataset, discovery tool and digital resource. The project is maintained on the Mina Rees Library’s GitHub page and will include: an open-source dataset of digital humanities projects and citation index information, data dictionary, data visualizations, and a project website with in-process blogging.

In subsequent phases of the project, the dataset will be refined and transformed into MARC records, which will be made freely available for download/import/sharing. The library also intends to create OCLC records to make the project catalog records available in Worldcat and CUNY’s OneSearch discovery platform. Integrating digital projects with more conventional forms of scholarship like books and journal articles may increase their use by those less familiar with DH.","Digital humanities (DH) projects are difficult to find if you don’t know where to look.

However, the civic data explosion has opened up a window of opportunity for communities to take advantage of this data and seek justice through its use.

In order to understand and use civic data effectively, the broader public needs resources and support. Because of their connections to local communities and their expertise as information professionals, library workers are well-positioned to facilitate civic data literacies among their patrons. Several libraries have implemented civic data literacy programs with success. At the same time, the role of libraries as civic data intermediaries is still emergent and many workers are not familiar with civic data work.

CUNY TV staff will continue this work with the intention of sustaining this project and making even more assets from these collections accessible.

CUNY TV has become the largest audiovisual archive within the CUNY system and has succeeded at developing and implementing efficient preservation and accessibility workflows. A number of these workflows rely on open source tools such as vrecord, QC Tools, MediaInfo, and FFmpeg, and they have become vital to processing and making accessible our audiovisual collections. This poster will explore a number of these tools and how the archive used them in the “Uncovering The City University of New York’s Audiovisual Heritage.” The CLIR grant gave CUNY the opportunity to not only apply these open source tools and workflows to collections within the larger CUNY system but to also improve upon these workflows. I will also explore some of the challenges that arose during this project and how we adapted certain tools and workflows to achieve the project’s goals.

In July 2021, Virginia Tech was one of many organizations targeted in the Kaseya ransomware attack. Kaseya VSA is a tool that handles automated IT operations. This attack occurred when a fake patch was pushed through to the VSA, which was determined to be a cybersecurity supply chain attack from the Russian group REvil. This attack encrypted data, prevented storage access, and renamed objects for VSA users, and offered a ransom for decrypting data. Virginia Tech University Libraries (VTUL) was one of seven Virginia Tech departments affected.

Approximately 11 terabytes of a staging server were corrupted, causing significant issues in our digitization lab. Collaboration between the Virginia Tech Division of IT, VTUL IT, digitization faculty, and preservation faculty lead the recovery process to successfully decrypt and recover from this attack and to document the recovery process.

This project demonstrates the rewards and challenges working with community-based organizations and supporting the organizational goals.,"The University of Southern California Digital Library has collaboratively built digital collections since the mid-1990s. Recent years have seen collaborations with contributors ranging from libraries, archives, and others interested in Southern California history. Successful projects with Los Angeles’ diverse communities led to Mellon Foundation funding for the migration of the Dance Heritage Video Archive from the Dance Heritage Coalition to USC Libraries, and its expansion to include Southern California. The project involved soliciting from arts organizations, choreographers, videographers, and dancers videos for digitization and acts as a case study with similarities to other digitization projects.

The new archival footage expanded the collection to include renowned ballet and modern dancers, as well as ethnic folk dance companies and dance festivals. These videos feature the life’s work of dancers, choreographers, and videographers which they and their families share with the broader community to keep their artistry alive and relevant. They demonstrate the importance of West Coast dance in understanding the history and culture of the United States. As with other collaborations, the project has a variety of stakeholders including the faculty at the USC Kaufman School of Dance, librarians, and students.

Through diversity and open access, we have given space to preserve underrepresented dance traditions from Southern California and enhanced the use of the collection not just by scholars in disciplines beyond Dance, but also by non-University affiliated dance communities. The digitization of performances like those captured in this collection has invigorated conversations that bridge dancers and traditions past and present.","The University of Southern California Digital Library has collaboratively built digital collections since the mid-1990s.

The Machine Readings Maps (MMR) funded by an NEH/AHRC grant has developed a workflow to create machine-readable data from text on maps, both as a means to make cartographic collections more accessible and interconnected, and as a source of unique historical, geographical and anthropological information researchers and the general public alike. This grant has focused on Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps from the Library of Congress and National Ordnance Survey Maps from National Library of Scotland.

For this project, we’ve explored the benefits of combining human and automatic annotation by integrating a custom version of the annotation platform Recogito with MapKurator, a machine learning (ML) pipeline for automatic text detection and entity linking. MapKurator suggests an initial set of text-bounding polygons, type of content, and links to knowledge bases such as gazetteers. Users can accept, edit or delete these suggestions in Recogito. This information can be stored and output.

In addition to the workflow and an overview of the tools, we will discuss the goals of the grant and our achievements to date as well as challenges faced by the project team. We’ll end with plans for future development and outreach activities.

The pilot has three aims: (1) to increase librarian and patron awareness of APIs as a data resource; (2) to develop workflows that support researcher access without taxing IT infrastructure; and (3) generate insights for future service developments.

The workflow relies on two products: online forms that will generate queries based on user input and Jupyter Notebooks that will help users make API calls using those queries. We leverage existing UofT infrastructure by encouraging users to execute these Jupyter Notebooks on the JupyterHub run by University of Toronto Central IT, eliminating the need for users to download Jupyter or any packages. These Jupyter Notebooks will not only execute calls, but also produce familiar csv files that researchers can use immediately.

While this pilot is preliminary and doesn’t fully abstract the workflow, we hope it will not only help researchers gain confidence with APIs, but also promote these APIs among librarians. Frequently, APIs–many of which we pay for as part of our subscriptions–are overlooked even though they can supply sought-for data and fulfill researcher requests. By developing the pilot around APIs that interest researchers conducting systematic reviews, we will target a user group that frequently interacts with the Library and thereby have access to researchers’ experiences, workflows, and responses to the pilot.

Without bringing together stakeholders, immediate project research goals would be near impossible to accomplish. This presentation highlights how collaborations are fundamental to the success of RADS, and how these partnerships contribute to a collective articulation of problems within the research data landscape.","As a result of recent federal policies requiring public access to research data, academic institutions have increasingly expanded their infrastructure to comply and implement the requirements of these policies and mandates. The National Science Foundation (NSF) funded Realities of Academic Data Sharing (RADS) Initiative is currently underway and is examining the cost to institutions and researchers to implement federally mandated public access to research data policies. RADS is also examining where researchers are sharing their research data and assessing the metadata quality of this data.

To answer these nuanced questions, collaboration with partners and stakeholders is essential. For instance, the RADS Initiative extends the work of the NSF-funded Workshop to Accelerate Public Access to Research Data (APARD), supported by the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU), and the Association of American Universities (AAU). APARD team members serve on the RADS advisory board and provide insight into project goals and objectives.

Further, six institutions examined in RADS research are part of the Data Curation Network (DCN), a community-led network of curators advancing open research by making data more ethical, reusable, and understandable. DCN members have a robust understanding of FAIR (meta)data, and their shared experience is invaluable to understanding the research data landscape.

The RADS initiative is impactful precisely because it is built on partnerships. Not only are these partnerships essential to the success of RADS, optimizing experiences and building connections within the research data landscape helps to meaningfully identify collective problems.

The LIS Education and Data Science Integrated Network Group (LEADING), a Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian (LB21) National Digital Infrastructures and Initiatives project, supported by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). LEADING extends the data science education pipeline, while building a diverse inclusive, equitable, sustainable and extensible network linking GLAMS, iSchools, and future professionals.
2. The IMLS Piloting Network at the U. Maryland, a project aimed at prototyping a pilot to support MLIS training through a collaborative network of educators and practitioners that enables the sharing and dissemination of Lesson Plans and Case Projects, based on a Computational Thinking (CT) framework and a Jupyter Notebook educational platform.
The presenters will provide an overview of the goals and accomplishments of these two projects, and engage attendees in a discussion on core values across all constituents.",,,"Marciano, Richard",U.

The service allows users to define scheduled crawls which will be run via instances of Browsertrix Crawler.,"Webrecorder project builds tools that specialize in a 'user-driven' form of web archiving, where the user is able to direct the archiving process through their browser.

One of our latest tools, Browsertrix-Cloud, is an ambitious automated crawling system designed to make web archiving easier and more accessible for everyone.

In the workshop, we will provide a brief introduction to web archiving and on the unique approach, focusing on high-fidelity and browser-based archiving, provided by Webrecorder tools.

Participants will learn how to use the open-source Browsertrix Cloud system in order to start a crawl, watch their crawl in real time, and view the replay of the crawl. We will go over where and how the crawled data is stored and how users can move it to a digital library repository of their choosing. We also address more advanced topics of browser-based crawling, such as troubleshooting and quality assurance of crawling, and crawling paywalled and private content and how Browsertrix Cloud will help with those areas.

Finally, we will discuss all the different ways libraries can use the Browsertrix Cloud system on their own to create and store web archives on their own in a decentralized way.

We propose a 45-minute DIY Session for members of the Deaf Catholic Archives team, each using 10-15 minute segments, to introduce this hidden collection and describe prioritized areas of consideration as the project gets underway. These areas include the development of workflows to address such complex issues as content selection, privacy concerns, and permissions, while mindfully incorporating the nuances of Deaf culture in all processes.

A priority of our project design is configuring workflows to identify and obtain permissions in order to make materials publically available after digitization. The collection includes over 200 newsletters, with copyright holders varying from international organizations to individual church parishes. Another priority is to identify and manage personally identifiable information contained in items selected for digitization, including birthdays, emails, and mailing addresses. Since this collection documents how Deaf Catholics practice their faith, personal stories are found throughout and those privacy concerns must be addressed as well. Workflows will be developed to review materials before being made public in our digital repository. A takedown policy will be established to address any privacy concerns after the project is completed.

Throughout this project, we strive to be mindful and inclusive of the Deaf community as we work with materials outside our knowledge base. In particular, we seek their input for description and metadata, and how to address offensive or outdated terminology, especially as part of the collection’s web presence.

Our presentation will address several topic areas listed in the call for proposals, including using digitized collections to amplify unheard voices; exploring the meanings of “hidden” and “accessible” across collecting contexts and populations served; addressing complex rights and ethical issues related to digitized collections; and building and maintaining equitable, authentic partnerships for digitization. Our request for consideration of a 45-minute DIY presentation will allow for a deeper dive into the aspects we are preparing to discuss than a shorter option would. However, we are prepared to scale back to a single 15-minute presentation on a single aspect if necessary.

Processing maps as data using machine learning tools holds promise for the digital humanities and other disciplines that seek to understand the history of a place. The team from Machine Reading Maps would like to find others who work with maps and/or are interested in developing machine learning assisted technologies for working with historical maps to be able to create data sets and compare map data.

Our current project integrates two techniques for dealing with maps, Recogito, which allows for human annotation and MapKurator which uses a machine learning approach to identify text, polygons, and assign text and semantic labels. We are interested in learning from others who are working on the problem of treating maps as data, as well as learning about how researchers and activists currently compile and use this data. We are interested in barriers they face in the use of digital maps and tools to annotate them in order to improve the tools and our workflow. Finally we’d like to learn more about how researchers and activists would use these tools and the data they generate if they were openly accessible so they could process many maps quickly. For example, we believe that comparing information from maps of the same area over time in the same series can provide insight into community growth, industrialization, historical inequities in land use, and environmental racism to name a few areas of potential investigation.

The project to preserve and publicly release the program’s video collection is a daunting undertaking that raises several challenges.","In its first decade, Arab American Television (AATV) reflected the zeitgeist of Southern California’s Arab American community. Then, in the 1980s it gained a national footprint via cable and satellite, moving into the center of national Arab American life. Importantly, it provided a window to a rich social, cultural, and political tapestry, one defined by social diversity, transnationalism and political dissent. Despite decades of programming that reached millions of American homes, AATV is relatively unknown. Only the faintest traces are findable online. The AATV collection, made up of thousands of videos, documents and photos, was a hidden collection. It sat forgotten in a storage closet for decades. My project is to digitize and present to the public AATV’s roughly 800 programs and thousands of raw videos, documents, photos and ephemera. the collection is a treasure trove that illustrates the vibrancy of a minority group that was thought to be marginal — but actually can make a claim on belonging.

Corporate scanning and conversion vendors offer the ability to digitize large volumes of material quickly and for a budget-friendly price; making them indispensable to libraries and archives constrained by lack of resources. But what happens when vendors overpromise and underdeliver? In 2015, when the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research embarked on the Edward Blank YIVO Vilna Online Collections Project (EBYVOCP), a seven-year initiative to preserve and digitally reunite its pre-WWII collections, it chose an outside vendor to handle digitization.

The initial results were promising: over half-a-million pages were digitized by the end of year one. However, by year 4 the problems and costs associated with quality control of the work done by the contractor were so high that project leaders could see no way to meet budgets, deadlines, and preservation needs without creating an in-house digitization lab.

In our presentation we will demonstrate that despite the steep learning curve involved with setting up an in-house lab and acquiring the technical skills to run it, moving away from the outside vendor was a productive decision that ensured on-time completion of the EBYVOCP at the end of 2021. The unforeseen bonus was that by becoming digitization experts ourselves - trained to complete projects using national standards for digital preservation and practice - YIVO’s digitization lab has become an important resource for other Jewish institutions navigating and planning digital projects.

Digitization began in January 2016 and continued through 2018.

Work has been ongoing to enhance the descriptive metadata of over 150,000 individual assets. Because a full-time position was not created for this project, this work has been done by numerous student workers and staff.

Even most scholars of Charleston omit the history of Jews. Only recently have scholars taken on the mantel of narrating the Jewish experience in the American South. Our panel will discuss how digitizing thousands of archival items and using inclusive descriptive metadata 1) amplifies the largely unknown history of Jewish Charleston and 2) highlights the connections between Jewish Charleston and broader historical narratives, including race relations in Charleston, Southern women’s identity, and white Southern identity during and after the American Civil War.

We will also discuss the project’s public and scholarly outreach taking form as a digital public history exhibit and lectures. By not only digitizing and creating metadata but including plans for interpretation (an exhibit and lectures), these hidden collections will garner interest from scholars, student researchers, local community members, and the public, including tourists. Our panelists are project team members with a wide range of roles in the project and experience levels.

Participants are encouraged to bring working materials for hypothetical or realized web archive collections, including seed lists and collection scopes.

Attendees will understand the difference between collection development policies, collection scopes, and appraisal strategies for web archives, and learn to apply existing appraisal theories and archival values to web archives selection. Workshop leaders will require a screen for laptop projection and 1-2 microphones.

Accordingly, the National Center for Data Services (NCDS) of the Network of the National Library of Medicine (NNLM) developed an annual Internship Program with the goal of providing practical experiences to graduate students from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups interested in learning about and gaining skills in data services. These internships were designed to include the soft and hard skills needed to enter data librarian positions, including working on a team, working in numerous points in the data lifecycle, scholarly dissemination, and obtaining a job. NCDS worked with partner organizations Data Curation Network and the NNLM Evaluation Center to develop project ideas, trainings, and placements for nine interns to work 10 weeks during the summer of 2022. The internship program was developed as part of the ""Leading the Charge"" EDI initiative by Hampton University and funded by IMLS. As part of this initiative, NCDS worked with EDI leaders and a consultant in development of the features of the internship.

This program serves to both grow the field by increasing capacity and to diversify the field by centering opportunities on BIPOC graduate students, not only as an introduction to data librarianship but acclimation to the field in a health sciences context. Interns gained practical experience while working with a mentor in a guided environment on structured data projects, helping to provide the interns with skills needed to be competitive for data librarian positions.

This panel will present the ideas and outcomes from NCDS’s first Internship Program. Panelists will discuss the need to provide opportunities to graduate students from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, talk about establishing structure and partnerships to help place interns, and opportunities for replacing these types of programs at other institutions.

Conveniently, the finished piece, its layers, and video time-lapse recording are all neatly packaged within the same native file format or saved as a nearly identical duplicate of the original file.

Having access to time lapse recordings enables researchers to better contextualize and understand an artist’s working methods when combined with looking at the layers. I forecast future demand for access to time lapse recordings and artist working files in the archive by examining contemporary digital artists’ online presences, noting the current popularity of time lapse videos on platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Youtube. There is such a demand for access to behind the scenes content like time lapse videos, that many artists have successfully monetized these videos by placing them behind a paywall on Patreon or Ko-fi, websites where users pay monthly to support an artist and access their behind the scenes content. Having established the value of this material, I discuss how these programs function and present several preservation concerns to consider.

To my knowledge, this is the first paper to discuss these specific drawing programs and the unique research potential of their native file formats in an archival context.

In this session, you will learn about the five main questions that text analysis can help answer:

* What are these texts about?

* How are these texts connected?

* What emotions (or affects) are found within these texts?

* What names are used in these texts?

* Which of these texts are most similar?

We will consider these questions and applications for text analysis. We will also build some datasets pulled from the scholarly content in JSTOR and Portico and even primary sources from JSTOR and third parties. Then we’ll explore our datasets in Constellate (the new service from ITHAKA which provides clear learning paths, the ability to easily build data sets using content from JSTOR and its partners, and a lab where you can practice using popular and widely available tools and techniques for text- and data-mining.)

This project began in Fall 2021 with the goal of making Brooks' work visible and accessible. Throughout the process the team agilely collaborated through a myriad of challenges.,"In 2013, the Rare Book & Manuscript Library (RBML) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (U of I) acquired the Gwendolyn Brooks Collection. Brooks was the first African American to win the Pulitzer Prize for her groundbreaking book of verse, Annie Allen. The U of I applied for and received a grant, ""Saving America's Treasures,” to stabilize materials within the Gwendolyn Brooks collection that were at risk and digitize a selection for increased access. This work enhances engagement opportunities globally, for research, scholarly and creative discovery of Gwendolyn Brooks. In the fall of 2021, stakeholders from the RBML, Digitization Services, Cataloging and Metadata, and Conservation units began describing, digitizing and treating selected material from the collection. We propose a panel discussion on our processes working with these materials at the DLF Forum in October 2022.

In our presentation, we plan to begin with a brief history of the collection at our institution before diving into discussion of the unique challenges we encountered endeavoring in the description and digitization for the personal papers of Gwendolyn Brooks.

The project began with a selected group of visual resources including a photographic album, scrapbooks, loose photographs, and notebooks. Our earliest project was colloquially called the Red Album, a photographic album comprised of mementos from Brooks’ personal and professional life. The Red Album proved challenging and our solutions might prove useful to other librarians working with, and describing, similar collections. The Red Album is complex in item-level details and was structured as a compound object for the sake of digital representation. The Red Album informed what metadata profile would become the standard for all following materials in the collection.

The process was not just creating access, but was truly getting to know Ms. Brooks in an intimate level at all the transitions of her life. The Gwendolyn Brooks Collection, beyond the Red Album, contains a huge number of physical formats and materials. This proved to be a navigational challenge at the digitization level. Our presentation will also look at how we proceeded, including the equipment and practices that were used to create digital representations across all material formats.

Another major component of this project has been the facilitation of many simultaneously moving parts. Collaborating between all stakeholders from disparate units at once allowed for a streamlined approach from description all the way to the entry of materials into the digital library, however, this came with its own set of obstacles. Part of our presentation will also focus on how we overcame them as a team. This project is still ongoing, as it was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we relish the opportunity to share our discoveries within this process and connect with others doing or planning to undertake similar work.

","Archivists and documentary producers will discuss the process of licensing archival content, from digitization, to discovery and access platforms, to legal considerations, and whether a licensing program is a good fit for your cultural heritage organization.","Archive-based television series have spurred an increased interest in licensing archival media. “Bingeable” series like Netflix’s “The Crown” incorporate archival footage into a dramatic series, while other highly-immersive series like “The 80’s: The Decade that Made Us,” capitalizes on archival media’s nostalgia factor. The demands for new programming driven by streaming providers such as Discovery+, HBO Max and Netflix has been positive for archives who are able to take advantage of licensing opportunities, in some cases licensing the same content to multiple different productions on the same topic. Concurrently, the continued acceleration of the podcast medium, and proliferation of content producers has generated an expanding audience for archival material.

In this session two archivists will describe their experience licensing audio/visual archival materials for use in commercial media. Archivists will discuss the reasons to consider licensing content, how to get started, and workflows for licensing different media types. They will also discuss some of the projects that benefitted by licensed archival content, and what legal considerations need to be taken into account before licensing content.

Archival footage producers on this panel will discuss how they search for footage, and what they look for when licensing footage. Digitization and digital libraries play a huge role in the increased demand for archival footage—since many producers do their research remotely, they rely on the availability of digitized footage in robust digital platforms that allows for easy searching and viewing across digital content. Digital video specifications and metadata descriptions for specific types of footage (B-roll, “sound on tape”) are important for this type of user.

Starting a fee-generating licensing program can be unfamiliar territory for Cultural Heritage Organizations who are focused on promoting universal access to materials. The panelists will discuss how licensing of collections for commercial uses can help fund ongoing digitization and access, ultimately supporting the ongoing research and the fair-use of collections.

This workshop will engage new users and existing experts in immersive technologies in the pedagogues of the toolkit - walking them through the necessary features to instructing students in XR and 3D technologies and experiences. We will also help potential users of the pedagogy start to brainstorm how they could incorporate these lessons or aspects of the lessons into their existing or new course / workshop materials. This workshop aims not only to make people familiar with various lessons, but also ensure that the materials developed will be used and impact immersive learning in university Libraries across North America.

Lessons in the toolkit cover several different 3D technologies. These include, Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies, 3D modeling and scanning software, and 3D game engines and WebGL platforms. While 3D/VR/AR technologies demonstrate real possibilities for collaborative, multidisciplinary learning, they are also fraught with broader concerns prevalent today about digital technologies. The lessons contained in the toolkit also address the social challenges of working with or teaching immersive toolkits, working to broaden the range of who feels included in virtual spaces and decolonize the technology. We recognize that our audience is familiar with aspects of either tools or theoretical frameworks, and seek to ensure both elements are fully integrated in their understanding of the toolkits pedagogies.

The paper aims to explain how Indigenous Elder’s oral histories influenced the work of the great academic and theorist Marshall Mcluhan

As professor of Media Studies at the University of Toronto, Marshall Mcluhan predicted that the digital revolution would lead to a re-tribalism and a return to an oral tradition. To flesh out this idea, McLuhan reached out to the Anthropologist Edmund Carpenter. Also at the U of T, Carpenter studied Indigenous traditions in Northern Canada. Their collaboration led to some of McLuhan’s most enduring discoveries about the relationship between people and media. These include ideas on pre-literate society, re-tribalism, and oral traditions.

",The University Libraries of Virginia Tech use its digitization lab to create high quality facsimiles of physical items. The libraries use simpler photography equipment for off-site projects that have different goals. This presentation examines key differences between digitization and photography and how they achieve their respective purposes.,"Digitization is done in a lab with a controlled environment. We prepare the material ahead of time to be shot methodically and systematically. The conditions in the lab are consistent every time work is done to ensure that the images we produce are accurate representations of the physical item. From the lighting to the color targets to the PPI, we strive for consistency and control to provide researchers and users digital surrogates that are as close to the real documents as we can.

Field photography refers to taking photographs on location with a camera, tripod, and sometimes photo lights. The examples are documenting the remodeling of a house and photographing the collection of the Taubman Museum of Art. One difference between the two is the treatment of color. In the house, the color of the natural light coming in through the windows changes throughout the day. We show the differences in the color instead of treating color as constant. The Taubman photos are primarily for publication and online access to the collections. We control the color, although the requirements are not as exacting as for a digitization lab.

In this 15 minute presentation, we will discuss the distinctions between the two approaches to creating digital images and the reasons for why both are necessary.

How should we credit users while protecting privacy? What are the ethics of attribution? How do you balance rigor and usability? Join four experts on crowdsourcing in cultural heritage to discuss the sociotechnical challenges of working with crowd-created data.,"Crowdsourcing is a popular methodology for cultural heritage institutions to engage audiences with the deep work of enhancing data about their collections, making them more discoverable and usable. Yet many project staff encounter challenges when they attempt to ingest crowdsourced data into their content management systems. User-contributed content (UCC) – transcriptions, translations, tags and description – rarely fits into CMS architecture. These data can challenge institutional authority, and providing attribution to volunteers may conflict with institutional policies. Representatives from four institutions will discuss the challenges in UCC integration, and how these limit the use of crowdsourced data.

This panel continues conversations from the “After the Transcription” symposium, which completed the NEH-funded Enabling and Reusing Multilingual Citizen Contributions in the Archival Record project at University of Texas. This project studied the technical and policy practices used by institutions using crowdsourcing. The resulting survey showed that practices vary substantially: some institutions never credit users as a matter of policy, while others include attribution in metadata records. The survey also revealed gaps between the export formats produced by crowdsourcing platforms and those needed by institutions.

FromThePage is a collaborative platform for transcription, indexing and metadata creation with roots in the digital humanities. Since 2010, the platform has added technical integration efforts with digital library systems including Internet Archive, CONTENTdm, Omeka, and platforms supporting the International Image Interoperability Framework. This experience has revealed several challenges facing the field: How can scholarly editions be repurposed to improve library metadata? How do format and attribution needs differ for end-users downloading transcripts for scholarly publication versus systems librarians updating full-text-search fields?

Zooniverse is the world’s largest platform for crowdsourced research. The Project Builder is a free tool that lets anyone run their own Zooniverse project and export results. The platform requires projects to make their data publicly available, but the easy software interface can obscure the labor required to work with results. Platform maintainers have addressed these difficulties by creating resources like ALICE, a browser-based app that allows staff to view and edit results from text transcription projects. The Zooniverse DH focus is now about shifting expectations of project builders from a “look how easy this is!” narrative, and instead providing the resources needed to plan for the entire lifecycle of a project, especially the data-focused work that takes place after the ‘public’ element is complete.

Transcriptions are the most common type of crowdsourcing data solicited by GLAMs because they broaden access to non-machine readable images of documents, and fill gaps in traditional archival description and metadata practices. Many GLAMs invite volunteer transcription to make their collections more accessible for people who use screen-readers. Despite the popularity of crowdsourcing project, and the utility of searchable text, practitioners experience challenges to the integration of crowdsourced data. Technical challenges include character length limits, poorly configured metadata fields, or searches that return irrelevant results. Jansson and Liew identify social challenges including anxieties among practitioners and the public about the accuracy of crowdsourced data and its place in the authoritative record.

Developed by an engineering team from CLIR and Stanford Libraries, the platform federates and makes accessible data about collections from around the world. With funding from the Qatar National Library, the project has made progress over the last several in implementing a multi-lingual interface in Spotlight, worked to automate the collection of metadata, and working with more institutions to broaden the scope of items discoverable through the interface.","The Digital Library of the Middle East offers free and open access to the rich cultural legacy of the Middle East and North Africa by bringing together collections from a wide range of cultural heritage institutions.

When faculty and staff from NYU Libraries sought to create a program of community building and collaboration during the remote-working days of the pandemic, they leveraged their CMS to disseminate information, encourage engagement, and collaborate with colleagues.","In this 15-minute presentation, we will share our experiences using our LibGuides CMS as a platform for an ongoing series of programs for the NYU Libraries’ community focused on learning and engagement around issues of inclusion, diversity, equity, belonging, and accessibility (IDBEA). In early 2020, the Libraries formed an IDBEA in Internal Community Community Building and Programming Working Group tasked with creating “a framework for planning ongoing programming that seeks to build community and social engagement amongst Libraries’ staff.” While finding ways to have meaningful collaborations among colleagues from different departments in large academic libraries can be difficult in the best of times, 2020 posed some unique challenges for the newly formed group. In the remote working environment of the time, digital tools were going to be necessary to fulfill the stated mission. There were several tools available for this purpose including cloud-based collaborative working documents and a wiki, but the LibGuides system was deemed best positioned to make the content accessible and appealing. The CMS allowed for sharing information, dynamic linking to other resources and sites, storing documents, and launching interactive tools. Moreover, the Libraries had recently implemented accessibility standards for the use of LibGuides, which ensured that the content would not present any accessibility challenges. Once the programming was completed, the ease of linking multi-paged guides to one another meant that an ongoing archive of the events and resources could be maintained and easily accessed by members of the community on an on-going basis.
