This committee will better enable us to leverage our strengths, promote collaboration and develop shared user experiences across our repositories.","The U-M Library has a long history in the digital realm. U-M Digital Library Production Service was created over 20 years ago as an entrepreneurial effort towards managing and hosting digital materials. The Deep Blue institutional repository followed as a means to provide broad access to research without publisher intervention. More recently, Deep Blue Data was launched as a related but distinct repository to provide support for researchers in sharing and preserving their data. And U-M Publishing built Fulcrum, a platform for hosting ebooks and associated digital media.

Up until recently we treated the development and operation of our repositories in isolation, but have formed a new steering committee to bring us together. In an era of reduced resources and with a recognition of the power of collaboration, we see distinct advantages in developing shared functionality, common policies, and consistency of user experience. Our steering committee is building alignment for a suite of connected services in the mission of the Library and developing a deep understanding of the missions and experiences of each repository. We are not a centralized body with control over the services we offer; direct authority is maintained by the unit responsible for the work. Instead, our purpose is to find ways to continue to serve user needs by finding commonalities and reducing barriers to enable us to accomplish more collectively than we could individually.

We look forward to a lively audience-led discussion about how they have approached their organizational structures in providing repository services.","The U-M Library has a long history in the digital realm.

When shedding a light on data collection and analytics, the BA team deployed a seamless and efficient workflow to manage the different operations related to digitization, data entry, reviewing and maintaining integrity to the metadata processes while enforcing different access level for the back-end users.

State of the art techniques were utilized to provide a user-friendly experience, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for digitized text objects and tiling for ancient maps visualization. In addition, specialized viewers were developed for the various media types.

The Bullet Journal Method developed by Ryder Carroll is an analogue way to “track the past, order the present, and design the future” by using just a notebook and pen. Bullet journals combine creativity with structure in a flexible format that includes list making, planning, and journaling. The Bullet Journal Method emphasises intentionality, mindfulness, and self expression.

","This presentation will provide an introduction to the Bullet Journal Method and focus on how it can be used at work, both as a personal productivity hack and as an outreach tool for highlighting archival collections. Bullet journals provide new possibilities for outreach and community building, collection development, and exploring archival materials through a new lens. I will share examples from my own experience of using a bullet journal for work and how that led to collaborative instruction sessions, collection development opportunities, and a new professional focus on project management. This presentation will provide attendees with a new perspective on collections, outreach, and their own note-taking habits.
The Bullet Journal Method developed by Ryder Carroll is an analogue way to “track the past, order the present, and design the future” by using just a notebook and pen. Bullet journals combine creativity with structure in a flexible format that includes list making, planning, and journaling. The Bullet Journal Method emphasises intentionality, mindfulness, and self expression.",,,"Suiter, Greta",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,United States of America,North_America, ,gsuiter@mit.edu,gretakuriger@gmail.com,gsuiter@mit.edu,"Suiter, Greta",gsuiter@mit.edu,,,0,,0,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,43566.4991087963,,0

These case studies will not only highlight varied and unique professional practices/experiences, but will center a spectrum of perspectives offered by panelists coming from both large, medium and small institutions/organizations, suggesting “adjacent” positions are not specific to any one type of archive, but considered useful and even critical to the operations of most archives.

This panel includes a range of institutional perspectives, from a public library to large and small and public and private academic libraries.

This is particularly true when they are considered as events, as climate change continues to accelerate the shifting boundaries and locations of glaciers and their effects on other entities. In an era of rapid change and destabilization, what is the role of the authority list in anchoring documentary practices to the unfolding of events around them? To this end, I will present a working ontology for modeling the changing aspects of glaciers with an aim for demonstrating the reusability of this event-oriented ontology towards new contexts.","The University of Colorado Boulder Libraries and the National Snow and Ice Data Center recently completed a CLIR grant to digitize and make available a collection of over 25,000 glacier images from around the world.

The current structure of cultural heritage preservation institutions—libraries, archives, historical societies, museums, monuments preservation organizations, etc.—has evolved over several centuries, entirely shaped by a pre-digital world. It is a loose network of institutions with limited funding, local constituencies and expectations, and, while often collaborative, with largely uncoordinated strategies for collection and preservation. Through the end of the last century, coverage of the world’s documentary heritage in its many pre-digital forms, while not ideal, had evolved to a predictable pattern. Coverage was considerably enhanced by the ability to collect retrospectively, to actively seek out and rescue materials previously overlooked. This is a modality that no longer works in the disruptive born digital world. The collective resources of our institutions are insufficient to the full scale of the digital collecting task, a scale potentially made larger by a need to collect “just in case” because there will be no “just in time” for an unforeseen demand.

While the act of collecting (or retaining in archives) is not synonymous with preservation, it is an essential pre-requisite. Even as digital preservation professionals toil energetically and brilliantly to devise means to address technical preservation challenges, the outcomes of their work are necessarily limited by the capacities of their parent institutions to curate and collect born-digital content. The challenge of preserving digital-only content needs to be met within a feasible, realistic economic and institutional context, determining highest priority strategic initiatives for limited resources.

In light of the disruptive challenges of the digital-only environment, we are at a critical juncture to re-examine the societal and institutional framework that serves to collect and preserve documentary evidence. At minimum, such an examination can lead to a more broadly shared set of priorities and expectations about what should be captured and preserved, better focusing future efforts; at best, it can identify additional players and resources to extend the capacity of society to preserve its story.

This panel will begin with a presentation that looks at the history and existing framework for the current preservation environment and consider where it does, and does not, match 21st century challenges. The presentation will frame issues for a panel of commenters with expertise and/or perspectives from: a library special collections, a specialized repository, a national library, community and personal archiving.
