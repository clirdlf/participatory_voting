Change may require modifications in workflow, priorities, policies, and even content. Staff members may need to be reassigned, dismissed, hired, and/or trained for new roles and responsibilities. New communication channels may need to be developed, and negotiation with administration may be key to continued funding. Legacy content may need to be transformed or migrated, and those processes developed, documented, and implemented.  Through it all, managers are likely to be challenged to both manage their own emotional reactions and to support employees as they go through their own grief processes, while still keeping the group functioning and focused on productive work.  We may have to step back from who we thought we were and where we thought we were going, to take stock and reconsider our careers even as we revise our systems, staffing, content, and directions.  Effective leadership requires diplomatic communication skills, the ability to shift focus to core functions and new directions, and empathic consideration for those impacted by the change. If we see change as a necessary part of life and as holding the potential for personal growth, it is possible to develop an appropriate response and find a positive focus even in the face of difficult transitions.

While creating context is recognized in North American archives as a core functioning, there has been little explored as to what context actually means, how that may differ between other institutions, and how it can be recognized or assessed (Lee, 2011).

However, it also maintains a diverse repository landscape that has grown and shifted over the the past two decades. Owing to a number of factors, there has been very little data standardization across the multitude of digital collections. This lack of standardization, combined with the endless possibilities for field customization by curators, faculty, and collection stewards, has led to the creation of a number of “snowflake” collections: each with its own unique set of needs, data structures, and field definitions.

As the Visual Resources Metadata Librarian, my current goal is to conduct a large-scale data cleanup project across Cornell library’s digital image collections. This initiative includes identifying and analyzing 1700 unique metadata fields in order to retrofit 300,000 records across 85 collections to an application profile. This project will therefore require a great deal of negotiation with stakeholders, both internal and external to the library. 

During this presentation, I will outline my work plan for addressing this massive cleanup, demonstrate some of the tools that I am utilizing, as well as present my preliminary work towards constructing a metadata application profile.

This talk touches upon the many challenges related to starting up or organizing digital archiving and preservation activities at a higher education institution, which should not be the sole responsibility of heritage units such as libraries and archives. 

The talk will report on a recent campus-wide stakeholder consultation exercise, of which the goal was to gain understanding of the current state of digital asset management practices, and to identify gaps and requirements. The talk will also cover findings and recommendations that emerged from the consultation, which form the basis of a program of work to advance digital assets management at the University. Components of the proposed program will be described, including a digitization and digital preservation center which serves campus needs, as well as how the program is being planned, will be organized and funded.

The problem of research
We can’t complete our conservation plan of the manuscript because we must solve the problems which faced us, we have to problems 
The first one is the weak structure of this group of paper, it is very brittleness and fragility, in addition to the difficulty of handles it.
The second problem is the burning and dark appearance and blocking degradation which caused by dark appearance and lead to blocking the written text and the difficulty of read it 
The aim of research
Improve the current condition of the weak structure of the seven papers to be safely handled. Extract the written text from all the seven papers to be available for scholars and researchers and make a digital preservation step . We divided our conservation manuscript plan to three steps
First : rescue the burnet appearance paper by consolidate it and find a good way to preserve it in  appropriate enclosures in  addition to using the multi spectral imaging method to extract the disappeared written text by using multi spectral imaging method and this step is our research topic

New professionals are often challenged to connect their pre-existing skills and knowledge with internal and external stakeholder expectations. Further, there is a need to balance the digital preservation best practices and standards with institutional realities and capabilities. Each speaker will address a case study of ‘best versus good enough’ from their residency project.

Working on large-scale digital preservation requires deciding what level of adherence to best practices is ‘good enough’ to preserve an institution’s digital content, so that efforts are sustainable and scalable given the institution’s resources. In order for digital preservation programs to become sustainable, less experienced professionals need to be trained and empowered, despite often lacking the expertise to implement technical tasks considered digital preservation best practices. Processing and appraising at scale introduces a number of unique opportunities and challenges, such as automating content selection through scripting, which is a task typically reserved for trained archivists. Joe and Elizabeth will discuss creating and implementing workflows for large-scale digital collections, training staff who are often excluded from digital preservation work, and finding a balance between what is ideal versus what is acceptable.

Similar challenges arise when providing access to digital archival collections and archivists must decide how close to best practices they are able to adhere. Projects with multiple stakeholders can lead to complex requirements and competing priorities. Furthermore, at large institutions digital preservation best practices may vary between departments, with marked differences between data and archival units. For example, data specialists use ‘live’ and versioned digital objects while archives prefer static ‘snapshots.’ Meredith and Charlotte will address the complexities of creating policies for digital collections in institutions with divisions that have competing ideas of ‘good enough.’

When new policies are implemented, institutions must adjust. While policies can be beneficial in the long-term, the actual implementation takes time, especially when it creates additional work in already busy work environments. Megan and Amy will discuss their work to foster openness, collaboration, and improved digital stewardship through the development and implementation of new tools, networks, and services to support the preservation of research data. They will touch on methods used to build data management plans, a science data catalog, and new digital services, while assessing needs and fostering openness and collaboration. Of particular importance is the open invitation for collaboration and commentary; these materials are intended to be ‘good enough’ to serve the community of practice today, with the hope that best practices will develop over time through sharing, experience, and collaboration.

From collaborations with university presses to institutional repositories to managing and publishing journals and open educational resources, libraries are supporting scholarly publishing in a number of creative ways. Libraries are uniquely positioned to play a role in campus publishing initiatives. In addition to often being considered a “neutral party,” library staff have extensive expertise in areas such as digital preservation, copyright, metadata, search engine optimization, and publishing platforms. As long term advocates for changes in scholarly communications, academic libraries have long been thinking about the skills, technologies, and logistics of exploring new publishing ventures while supporting existing ones.

For many libraries, the first step is to evaluate their existing resources and then identify possible campus partners.  This can be challenging, as the needs of campus partners may not be immediately apparent.

The nature of digital content and its chain of interdependencies puts this material at significant risk.

At the same time, ‘the right to be forgotten’ is an important issue that the European courts, libraries, and archives are struggling with managing. Creators have less control of their content, uploading to the web is essentially publishing. Many creators are unaware of the complex nature of publishing on the web, legal terms, and physical ownership of the bits that represent content.

Preservation and conservation are related, but distinct concepts. Similarly, levels of digital preservation represent a spectrum of way in which we can handle digital content. Curatorial choices will affect our knowledge of and exposure to personal information in our born-digital collections. These choices should be informed by a framework of professional ethics and understanding of evolving impacts. 

Too often there is a desire to grab as much content as possible to head off the digital dark age. Archivists know that over collection is a disservice to our users. Because internet users don’t always think of downstream consequences, macro approaches to preserve internet content may violate their privacy.

News applications, or interactive databases that make up some of the most sophisticated journalism stories being produced today, are one type of dynamic objects in dire need of archiving and preservation solutions. Unlike most born-digital news content, news apps rely on databases and complex layers of software to function and display. They cannot be fully captured by web archiving tools such as Archive-It, and as such, they are currently disappearing. 

This research focuses on finding a path toward capturing and archiving these data journalism stories. The first step in this process was to gain a better understanding of the number and nature of news apps being produced. This presentation will share the results of a news apps survey, which gathered data from some of the major national and international organizations producing these stories, including the Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, The Guardian, the Wall Street Journal, and ProPublica, among others. Our analysis describes the code, data, software libraries, and server environments that make up these news apps, as well as the proprietary and licensing information related to the data and editorial content. This environmental scan of news apps is, to our knowledge, the first survey of its kind, and we plan to use the results in developing recommendations for tools to capture, archive, and preserve these vital data journalism stories so that they may be accessible to future scholars.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--0900:00,,0

Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic shift away from microfilming and toward digitization and digital acquisition of copied materials.  Annually, the museum acquires between 3 to 5 million pages of digitized documents. This introduces a host of digital preservation challenges: from assessing our long-term preservation responsibility for unoriginal material to documenting the technical specifications used during digitization.         

The Museum duplicates records for a variety of reasons: lack of resources to preserve at the holding institution; willful neglect or destruction (including hostile acts); unpredictable political climates and rising antisemitism; inherent acidity and poor quality of wartime paper; and the scattering of collections due to wartime events.  In many cases, the Museum works closely with US diplomatic services in foreign countries and partner institutions -- pushing year-after-year to find the right political or administrative climate to go into repositories, survey collections, and duplicate original holdings.  Often, the door is closed after we are able to make copies.  For example, many former Soviet Archives were opened shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union, allowing the Museum to go in and duplicate collections.  Today, however, much of the material available to researchers at the Museum is now largely inaccessible from the holding repositories.      

The focus of this presentation will be on the Museum’s work to acquire Holocaust documentation; create a digital preservation decision matrix to classify the preservation requirements for “copy collections;” assess long-term digital preservation risk; and ultimately preserve these digital holding in an ever-changing geopolitical environment.

Given that the presentation of cultural heritage content online inevitably displays bias, how to present it without being exploitative is a fine line and requires librarians to be arbiters of ethical considerations.

With digital preservation, we often operate in a sort of liminal zone where policy and procedures are grainy so we ought to be talking about organizational strategy more than we do.  By and large it doesn’t happen because organizational strategies are opaque with respect to digital preservation. There should be a discussion about values that guides us through that uncertainty.  But there doesn’t seem to be a significant amount of evidence of that. Instilling the ideals of a deep preservation culture requires a custodial chain that connects the following concepts: procedure; policy; strategy; and values. If you don’t know what procedure to follow refer to policy; if you don’t know what policy to follow look at organizational strategy; if you don’t know where you fit in the strategy look at the values.  If you don’t recognize the values then you are really in trouble.

These issues become amplified when one considers the possibility of using preservation services that extend beyond one’s jurisdictional boundaries. Coupling the need for security both for and against political entities makes amplifies the politics of preservation. How can we leverage global partners to place content out of harm’s way?

Now almost 35 years after the projects conclusion, memory of the study is fading as are the technologies used to preserve this subjugated knowledge.  The preservation of these materials at the Library and Archive Canada (LAC), means the oral history has largely gone unused due to complications and access costs.
Recent shifts in the social work profession, in particular neo-liberalism and austerity challenge social workers to consider what it means to be a leader in the profession, and what kinds of leadership are most likely to preserve and enhance social justice. Turning back to the history of the profession and considering the techniques and approaches used by social workers may hold utility for contemporary leaders.

A major challenge is that DACS, the official content standard of the U.S. archival community, has been slow to adapt to the increasing presence of digital material in collections. This is compounded by DACS having relationships to other standards, such as MARC and EAD, which do not always align in the context of born-digital. 

The lack of clarity and agreement in this area has resulted in a proliferation of finding aids that fail to adequately express the quality, quantity, and usability of digital material. This both diminishes accessibility and ensures that each organization must ‘re-invent the wheel’ when it comes to describing this content.

The PEGI project has been informed by a series of meetings between university librarians, information professionals, and representatives of federal agencies, including the Government Publishing Office and the National Archives and Records Administration.  There is now a growing awareness nationally of the serious ongoing loss of government information that is electronic in nature.  This issue has loomed larger in recent years, reaching a point of criticality that drove intense discussions in recent meetings of information management thought leaders from across the United States.  Summits held in April and December of 2016 sought to explore ways of undertaking urgently needed cross-sector activities to preserve and provide access to electronic government information.
This project proposes focusing on activities of triage, drilling down into agency workflows, differentiating the audiences for electronic government information, mobilizing collaborative efforts, and undertaking advocacy and outreach efforts to raise awareness of the importance of preserving digital government information.  The project will conduct a comprehensive multi-modal environmental scan of at-risk federal digital content.  Guidance documents will be produced by the PSC and project staff for agencies and other publishers of government electronic information.  These documents will take the form of recommendations for best-practices in information lifecycle management that could improve the preservability and accessibility of electronic information produced by the content creator.  An educational awareness and advocacy outreach program will take place in 2018, the second year of the project.  The aim of this program will be to start new dialogues on the issues in preserving and providing access to electronic government information, engaging the broader library community, relevant academic and public scholars, federal agencies, and other relevant stakeholders.

We’ll introduce the panel with a proposed definition of service management that we hope will resonate with the community. This will provide a touchstone we can revisit throughout the panel discussion, to “kick the tires” and see if it holds true. Using questions solicited from the DLF membership prior to the Forum, as panelists we intend to weave common themes revealed in the questions -- in lightning talk style/format. Each panelist will outline their service management role at their institution, and lay the foundation for open discussion by revealing both successes and learning opportunities they have experienced. Community questions along with audience queries will drive the remaining, and most substantial part of the hour with facilitated dialogue.
 
The goals of the panel are to support and encourage interested DLF members in furthering the discussion of their service management work, to share locally developed best practices and frameworks and explore training venues. An opportunity exists to establish the value of service management work in the digital LAM community to: organizations, management and our immediate team members and allied colleagues. Can a threshold be established for a service needing a service manager, where one may not exist?  How does service management practice contribute to successful, established teams? What value is added by incorporating service management principles into existing digital LAM programs? Who typically performs service management work, and does it have a gendered association? How do we value service management work in organizations where it already exists? Issues of compensation and organizational relationships are challenging, yet ripe topics for exploration. Issues of diversity in staffing service management roles, when and where they exist, are among the tough questions we must ask. Who does the work? Who might be excluded from it? Who avoids it?
 
Ultimately, as with all DLF community dialogue, the attendees, panelists, questioners and other contributors will grow the service management community of practice with the umbrella of support and encouragement provided by DLF and CLIR. As panelists we’re seizing a moment of intense interest, sparked by a discussion on the DLF project managers list, to share our experiences and learn from our colleagues in the audience. We may be the ones brave -- or foolish! -- enough to serve as panelists, but we’re confident there is a wealth of knowledge amongst our colleagues we’d like to draw out.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--0900:00,2017--1200:00,0

As a land-grant institution with a strong service mission, the University Libraries at Virginia Tech has developed a digital preservation service aimed at the development of partnerships with regional cultural heritage organizations. A prime example of such a partnership lies in the work provided by data curation and digital preservation services to the Barter Theater.

Barter Theater is an arts organization located in rural southwestern Virginia. In 1933 Robert Porterfield, a local actor, brought a group of professional actors to Abingdon and opened a theater during the Great Depression. The theatre got its name from its practice of allowing audiences to barter food for admission. It has since distinguished itself as the State Theatre of Virginia and has had a significant impact on Virginia’s culture and economy. Having such a historical significance the digitization and dissemination of Barters archive has been long overdue. In effort to support the preservation of Barters archive, Virginia Tech began a pilot project to help digitize their archives. The project consisted of converting an obsolete proprietary database saved on outdated media and converting it to an open format saved to stable media.

The IMLS-funded event was designed as an opportunity to allow members of the NDSR community to build connections, present achievements, share knowledge, and discuss the sustainability and long-term goals of the NDSR initiative. Over the course of the two-day Symposium, speakers presented around five suggested topics: models and strategies for making programs like NDSR sustainable; expanding the geographic reach of NDSR; methods of fostering a digital preservation community of practice; raising awareness of the NDSR program; and models and strategies for effective mentorship. After the presentations, attendees joined in small-group discussions to create the framework for an NDSR Handbook that would provide guidance for future NDSR programs and the development of a national NDSR model.

National Digital Stewardship Residencies (NDSR) have branched, by funding from IMLS, into areas outside of the original NDSR DC environment, leading to the creation of the Biodiversity Heritage Library cohort, American Archive of Public Broadcasting cohort, Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Art Libraries Society of North America (ARLIS/NA) cohort. If anything, this has underscored the success NDSR residencies have in serving as a launchpad for the careers of residents. Featuring recent residents and mentors from Georgetown University and Johns Hopkins University, this presentation will focus on how residencies can be made into win-win situations for both the residents and the institutions. Perspectives from the residents’ side on their expectations, and how they are using the residencies to launch their careers will be discussed, while mentors will discuss how they turn these opportunities into ones that help the institutions make cases for personnel and resources, and jump start projects locally.
	While the panel will focus on recent NDSR residencies at these two institutions, we’ll also conceptualize how the strategies could be generalized across other residencies that may not be a part of the NDSR model, and how institutions can use, and build upon, residencies. Often the discussion of residencies focuses around tools and concepts, however, in this presentation we'll include how they helped the host institutions analyze and modify existing strategies and workflows, based on the discoveries and work done by the residents. This will lead into a discussion of the positive changes that the residents and their work can bring about in their host institutions, and help them reassess and reinstitute modified strategies that can benefit the institutions considerably. Often making these suggestions can be politically fraught. How does the resident come in as an outsider and give a thorough critique of existing strategies without offending those who created the strategies in the first place? From the residents’ perspectives, the discussion will focus on core competency expectations, reality, and the ‘acronym soup’ in digital preservation projects. As new professionals in the digital preservation realm, do residents’ expectations align with reality, and if not, where are the distinctions and can the gap be bridged in some way, or does it even need to be?
	At the same time there can be scope creep in these projects, causing the resident to take on too much work outside their project and creating an imbalance between benefits received by resident and host. In what ways can a residency be made to maintain this balance while many institutions are in a situation where they are being forced to “do more with less.” The audience will leave with tangible ideas on how residencies can benefit their institutions and if there are Library Science/Archives/Information Science students in the audience, they’ll get ideas for how residencies can benefit their career and how expectations can differ from reality in practice.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--0900:00,,0

The presentation will focus on variations of how to move forward once a digital preservation plan has been developed or not and platforms and environments have been selected. Should everything be expected to flow smoothly? What can digital preservationists in libraries anticipate and expect, and how might they handle failures and issues once they are encountered? Once a library administration has given funds for this preservation platform, how do you deal with the internal political pressure to implement these services to show that it is not just money going to waste?
While the presentation will discuss workflows and technological setups that were developed at the two libraries (with many solutions that are available as open source), it will also engage in a discourse of expectations, successes, and failures. Digital Library and Digital Preservation staff are often expected to develop seamless and functional operations once a digital preservation platform or environment has been selected, however, the reality is vastly different. Through this panel discussion, we’d like to bring to the forefront the issues that may arise in even the best-laid plans, including in workflows that have been thoroughly tested. Can we ever say that we have a complete grasp on the entirety of our assets that need to be preserved? If not, then when do we feel good enough to move forward with our plans? 
The Libraries at both institutions use Academic Preservation Trust (APTrust) as part of their preservation environment. We’ll discuss the successes and issues involved in designing, implementing, and automating workflows for digital assets that are housed in different digital repositories and content storage areas. This will involve showcasing the locally developed tools, considerations, and workflows for each of the asset classes and the local policies that help us keep an inventory of our submissions. Considerations and the underlying conceptualization of workflows for the purposes of preservation and access will be shared along with how they could be generalized for broader use by the community. 
The attendees will not only leave with an idea of where to go once a preservation plan has been created and a preservation environment has been selected but will also know where to access open source tools that can be generalized for setting up local workflows. Furthermore, we hope that the attendees will have an open discussion about what the roadblocks to implementing digital preservation strategies are so that as a community we can identify common areas that need improvement and resources to help us more forward towards the goal of preserving our digital assets.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--0900:00,,0

The recent behavior of the U.S. Federal Government is only the most recent; it echoes the purging of government datasets and historical records by Canada's Harper administration just several years ago. Examples like these are, sadly, not historically novel; they reflect a common impulse of those in power to censor information that runs contrary to their agenda.

We are more vulnerable to these attacks than we've ever been. In a print world, distributed repositories maintained local copies of government information through programs like the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). Digital information has decoupled the necessary connection between distributed access and distributed custody, at once making the dissemination of government information more efficient but also more easily altered or deleted.

What we need to address these threats is the strategy we've always ever relied upon: lots of copies, keeping stuff safe. It matters also that the copies be maintained in independent repositories that remain skeptical about the integrity of information stored in others, and that themselves operate transparently. Finally, digital information allows for an enhanced mechanism of mutual audit of the replicated copies.

The LOCKSS Program has built software and supports networks that provide these features. We're one of many organizations and communities working in this space.

Each of these Residencies has faced political challenges both within the organizational host as well as within the program that administers the group of Residencies.

The members of the panel will represent a wide range of experience across different types of organizations including government agencies, an international organization, academia, libraries, and museums. Members of the panel have also been selected based on their first hand experience and research into the challenges of building bridges with the information technology community, both within their own organizations and throughout the digital preservation community.

Some topics that are likely to be discussed include: 
Identifying and winning allies
Finding common language
Spotting roadblocks
Understanding the priorities of IT teams

Staff working with digital materials in small institutions have more competing demands on their time, but also have the ability to effect change at multiple stages of the digital records lifecycle: writing more critically engaged policy, developing documentation strategies to focus on dissent and underrepresented voices, collecting materials with thoughtfulness about power relationships and consent, developing equitable relationships with records creators, shaping descriptive practices with appropriate community context, ensuring adequate levels of preservation for threatened materials, providing accessible platforms for users, and bringing in members of the community and staff at all stages as full collaborators.

A rich body of scholarship has further advanced the insight that artifacts can embody, advance and inhibit specific human values.   As caretakers of information artifacts, information professionals are significant actors in such politics.
In order to understand the role that digital preservation plays in the politics of digital information, it is important to recognize that, unlike analog artifacts, digital objects reside at several distinct, but interrelated levels of representation.  The decisions that information professionals make related to those levels of representation can have dramatic effects on what voices are heard, what interests are represented and how identity is shaped.

In light of recent political changes in the United States, the wisdom of this decision seems more manifest. Should we, however, be so confident that having all of our data inside Canada is the best longterm solution for preservation?

The issue of extra-territoriality and its ramifications for preservation are not new. David Rosenthal, among others, has raised them, noting in 2014 that “developments appear to have destroyed any case there might have been for outsourcing archiving across national borders” (http://blog.dshr.org/2014/08/national-hosting-of-archives.html). While this rationale drove us, in part, to propose and develop the OLRC, this solution does not answer another nagging question. If we are positing that our preservation programs will ensure viability across decades by leveraging emergent technologies, are we sufficiently hardening them against radical political shifts: revolutions, regime change, fascist uprisings?

This may seem to be fear-mongering or yet another overreaction to the recent U.S. election, but it is not difficult to trace in both the recent and more distant past political changes that could or likely would have wiped out digital copies of archival materials as they did analogue materials, e.g.- decades ago in Germany, more recently in Iraq and Syria.

If such a characterization is assumed, then the effectiveness of any particular digital preservation strategy will have some a “floor” defined by the point at which the effectiveness passes below the threshold of acceptability.  Such a formal view helps in making this point: Every digital preservation strategy has some floor below which it becomes ineffective. The lower the values of constituent metrics at which the floor lies, the more robust is the strategy. 

Given this framework, the question of how low this floor is in each metric can have economic, political, psychological and even metaphysical implications. Are some impossible? What about if North America loses power for a month? a decade? Do some offend your morality? Do we preserve the writings of terrorists? child pornography?

As these are also often free, libraries face increasing difficulty in retaining, let alone increasing, service adoption by their stakeholder communities.  One possible solution is suggested by questioning the often tacit assumption regarding the centrality of custodial stewardship.  What are the consequences of shifting curatorial imperatives away from *holding* a copy of a given information object to *knowing* where all its copies are?  This talk explores ideas for a post-custodial stewardship regime under which curatorial functions are applied in situ to radically-dispersed content.  In today’s do-it-yourself information environment, content will inevitably be manifest in a wide variety of venues.  While these individually may fall well short of embodying desirable levels of reliability and persistence, harnessing enough of them together within a unified post-custodial framework can nevertheless result in desirable global outcomes.  A post-custodial pattern of stewardship embraces, rather than futilely combats, the realities of today’s information ecosystem, filled with many well-funded commodity service providers.  Post-custodial curation has the potential to turn these (probably unassailable) competitors into (possibly unwitting) collaborators, and, through an appropriate division of labor, encourages libraries to direct their finite programmatic resources towards high-impact initiatives where they can uniquely add value.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--1600:00,2017--1900:00,0

As such, there is a compelling area within digital librarianship that touches on ethical issues and practice, stemming from many of the issues which surrounded the 2014 Spanish court case that has been more commonly referred to as the 'Right to be Forgotten'.

In the spring of 2017, Kent State researchers surveyed digital librarians and digital collection managers at ARL institutions to investigate the current practices and policies surrounding takedown requests in openly accessible digital collections. The survey collected basic demographic information on the digital repositories and also presented a series of hypothetical scenarios for respondents to consider. We received over a 23% response rate, with intriguing insights into practice and policy of these institutions. The findings will be presented, along with a discussion on future recommendations for work in this gray area.

Overall, the findings point to a large variety in the way professional librarians handle these requests in digital repositories, without clear guidelines for practice. Often coupled with a misunderstanding of copyright and fair use, this erratic behavior likely will continue without either best practices recommended by professional organizations or sufficient case law to guide practices.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--1600:00,,0

Publishers share data to build trust with residents through transparency and hope to stimulate civic engagement and innovation by making datasets originating from governmental agencies and civic organizations easily accessible online. Libraries have begun getting involved with managing civic data and our panel will showcase three example projects and models for managing city-level data.

In fall 2016, the Temple University Libraries received a Knight Foundation News Challenge Grant to explore the ways libraries can support preservation and long-term access to open civic data through community information portals by using OpenDataPhilly.org, which is managed by multiple partners, as a testbed. The grant project focused on researching use cases, interviewing stakeholders, testing archiving and preservation prototypes: Archive-it and the Dat Project, and writing a white paper detailing the findings.

The Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC) began in 2015 and is managed by the University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Social and Urban Research. The project is a partnership of the University, Allegheny County and the City of Pittsburgh. The Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center serves as a data intermediary, and supports key community initiatives by making public information easier to find and use. The WPRDC works closely with local academic and public librarians to support a growing ecosystem of data providers and data users. 

Analyze Boston is the City of Boston's central open data hub to find facts, figures, and maps related to our lives within the city. The project reimagined open data with a library science lens and an emphasis on curation. They work to make this the default technology platform to support the publication of the City's public information, in the form of data, and to make this information easy to find, access, and use by a broad audience. Analyze Boston was made possible by a generous grant from the Knight Foundation, through the Knight News Challenge on Libraries, that established the Open Data to Open Knowledge project. 

The panel will describe several organizational models, and address various challenges, such as, providing explicit roles for civic and university libraries in a civic data ecosystem, long-term data preservation and archiving,  data verifiability, management and delivery of very different of data formats, legal issues, collaboration across multiple types of institutions, engagement of the community, and planning for sustainability.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--1700:00,,0

While lower costs and greater computational power have made 3D technologies financially realistic for a broader variety of institutions, there remains an absence of community standards and practices for producing, managing, and preserving 3D content. Librarians at four research universities will present their experiences staffing, funding, piloting, and launching 3D imaging programs at their institutions in order to demonstrate their approaches to production, management, preservation, and dissemination of 3D images.

The discussion begins with the limitations and applicability of a 3D project which is influenced by technology and various stakeholders. Stakeholders that influence outcomes and processes of a 3D project include a principal investigator who initiates and participates in the development of a particular project, the technical service provider who creates and/or processes 3D data, the audience who dictates the product and impact of a 3D project, and funders and administrators who have sway over how the project is shaped.
There are various methods to create digital 3D data, and program managers should know the benefits and limitations of each each. Examples include structured light scanning, photogrammetry, laser scanning, and LiDAR scanning. Understanding the desired outcome drives the choice in methodology, as each has its own strengths and limitations. This panel will go into detail about the opportunities and challenges that each technology affords.  
	
The hardware and software for creating and capturing 3D digital data are even more varied than the methods. Choosing the technology and hardware can be daunting and expensive. Setting up the environment and post-processing are both skill and time intensive. The skills required to apply each tool may vary. Potential limitations include time, expertise, funds available, and the envisioned user experience. These factors all have varying influence on the decisions regarding technology hardware and software.

Access and discoverability is another area with a lack of standardization of practices across institutions engaged in 3D imaging. Repositories, such as Sketchfab, allow sharing of digital 3D models. There are also subject-based 3D focused repositories, such as Morphosource and subject based repositories that will accept 3D, such as tDAR.  In many cases these data are openly shared. Some methods for displaying 3D digital data include embedding via html iframe into contentDM or WebGL / javascript libraries to display 3D online without plugins. Metadata greatly improves discoverability, but no common standard has emerged for 3D metadata, and the platforms mentioned here lack a number of essential preservation and discoverability criteria.

Preservation is essential to maintaining the integrity of digital data.  Preservation actions are taken to prevent loss and obsolescence for all kinds of data to ensure that data is in shape for long-term access and reuse. 3D data are particularly vulnerable to data loss, often by the nature of their creation. This creates a preservation challenge for the raw data, as well as other issues.

Beginning in 2002, the Digital Library Brown Bag Series presentations initially focused on digital library standards, tools, and trends but has since expanded to include broader topics relevant to digital scholarship, including digital humanities and open access publishing. Similarly, the workshop series has evolved to encompass new services, tools, and resources by providing workshops designed around technologies available in the space and through mini-series like CartoShop: Workshops on Digital Mapping, Monday Motivators, provided by Counseling and Psychological Services, and the Maker Monday Series, which focuses on DIY projects and innovative technologies that foster creativity and learning.

The interface guides users through finding items to edit, adding statements, adding qualifiers to statements and adding references. This portal will make it easier for people to contribute structured data related to this domain. Structured data about the technical metadata in the domain of computing is essential for digital preservation. This structured data can be used to power workflows in digital preservation systems. Due to the fact that this structured data is available as freely-reusable linked open data, digital preservation systems can query needed data on the fly. 

Contributing structured data to Wikidata helps to improve this key piece of infrastructure of the semantic web. Wikidata is a multilingual knowledge base supporting more than 200 human languages. Wikidata is built entirely with free software. Not only is all of the content in Wikidata freely reusable under a Creative Commons 0 License, the software itself is freely available for reuse. Once we describe software, file formats, and configured environments in Wikidata, other organizations can reuse this data, saving description labor that would otherwise be done at many institutions redundantly.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--1800:00,,0

It is unlikely that the text is fully unique, (barring errata, one offs, or marginalia) and most often it is accessible via online databases or in print by more contemporary publishers. So what qualities do rare materials hold over their contemporary textual mirrors? At first this seems like an easy question to answer; their centrality as material objects and unique windows into the publishing world's ancient (and not so ancient) past. Their rarity, this uniqueness, is important to their entire purpose in a special collections repository. What happens if the object is not in front of you but rather mediated through a computer screen? What truth or weight does a digital rare book hold? How do we quantify use in the digital realm?  

This paper explores the problems of digital rare book surrogates, particularly how libraries can transition to new modes of use for these objects. It explores how new insights can be gained through digital surrogates while increasing the points of access beyond the footprint of the library. The digitization of rare materials creates opportunities for digital scholarship and digital humanities, allowing both close reading and what Franco Moretti terms ""distant reading."" In what ways could these outweigh the materiality of the rare book, not as a pure replacement but as a true surrogate that increases the utility and the impact of a single book?",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--1800:00,,0

The letter identifies that about 40% of libraries have broadband that is 10 mbps or less, while the FCC minimum standard is 100 mbps.

Meanwhile, advocacy groups are organizing on the local level and joining larger alliances to develop shared vocabularies, activities, and meaningful metrics. Common goals include access to low-cost broadband, digital literacy training, affordable computing, and access to public computing centers.

I propose a new incentive infrastructure to promote voluntary data sharing and to improve the quality of shared data. I suggest that we should continue to recognize research materials (data, software code, and other study materials) as independent items apart from a research paper, and that the authorship of each research material should be separate from the authorship of the research paper. This incentivizes junior researchers (research assistants), who actually produce research materials, yet receive no credit for their work unless they are invited to participate as an author of the research paper.

The proposed infrastructure will motivate and empower traditionally unrecognized contributors. This will not only increase voluntary data sharing but also improve the quality of research materials. Moreover, the new infrastructure will be a catalyst for junior researchers to adopt good research practices early in their career.

This was part of a broader year-long, domain-based RDM training series for librarians. In this instance, the challenge came in translating RDM methodologies to make them relevant to librarians and archivists who do not necessarily think of their work as data-centric. Moreover, these librarians and archivists often work with researchers who may not conceive of their research materials as “data” and who may even be hostile to such a conceptualization. After consulting with faculty and staff stakeholders, we developed a curriculum of practical sessions underlined by RDM methodological framings that focused on real workflows from researchers and librarians on campus. By taking an approach that explored components in the research data lifecycle through humanist use cases, librarians and researchers could map abstract concepts to recognizable problems. We found that by addressing specific researcher cases, tools, and strategies, workshop attendees could bridge the disciplinary and ontological “data” gap that often divides the arts and humanities from the sciences. As we developed the series, we identified opportunities to collaborate with campus partners (the Art History department’s Visual Resources Center and Education Technology Service’s Academic Innovation Studio) and national organizations (Modern Language Association).",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--1900:00,,0

What are the strengths and weaknesses of such interfaces in affording agency and empathy for survivor-users? 

Finally, the presentation will turn outward to look at survivor-centered practices in non-archival digital spaces, such as creative manipulation of Tumblr metadata and plugins by survivor communities on the site, and design practices in websites for domestic violence shelters, and explore the implications of such practices for digital archives interfaces.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--1900:00,2017--1900:00,0

There have been an increasing number of preservation storage options in the past few years, and while these are a healthy sign of the growth of the digital preservation community, the additional options may provide a challenge for decision makers. Decisions about which combination of preservation storage services and providers will work best are influenced by factors like the nature and extent of the content to be preserved as well as the scale and mission of the preserving institution. The Digital Preservation Storage Criteria  (https://goo.gl/6HP2h5) document was developed In order to assist in this decision making process.

The Digital Preservation Storage Criteria is a work in progress, intended to list the key criteria that differentiates preservation storage from other types of storage, for example short- or medium-term storage. These Criteria describe characteristics of preservation storage that are relevant to a wide range of different kinds and sizes of institutions with responsibility for preserving digital content. Like the National Digital Stewardship (NDSA) Levels of Preservation, it is designed to be an easy-to-use and to help institutions just starting out with preservation as well as institutions with established preservation programs.

Libraries, archives, and museums across the globe have been increasingly making their collection materials available to the public digitally, but online assets have essentially been locked into repository-based silos, with incompatible systems and varying user interfaces that place a burden on hosting institutions and limitations on functionality for end-users. Working independently, many institutions have found digital image repositories challenging to maintain, with constantly evolving user needs and ever-changing technology systems as digital content is migrated from one bespoke application to another.

Working together in response to these challenges, institutions and individuals from across the cultural heritage community developed the IIIF specifications to provide a standard practice for making digital images available online, allowing for the transfer and sharing of image pixels, metadata, and annotations across repositories and systems. Adoption of the IIIF specifications can provide end-users with the ability to compare images from across multiple repositories and interact with them through deep pan and zoom, image manipulation (size, quality, rotation, etc.), the ability to tag and annotate, search within annotations, and easily share work with others. Several image servers and clients that support IIIF already exist, allowing institutions to easily mix and match technologies and maintain their repositories while avoiding costly system overhauls, migrations and re-designs. The IIIF community is active and growing, and we welcome more participants to get involved.

Data repository
    Based upon a repository containing all the objects’ information such as; metadata, storage location and status of digitization.
The repository’s components rely on :
      •	A content index
      •	A metadata index 
      •	A triple store
      •	A Database
      •	Restful Access API
This module provides an OAI-PMH interface for metadata harvesting. The media will be grouped under each project’s collections. 
Data Entry Controller Service
    Ingests the objects in the metadata repository and synchronizes the metadata between the metadata sources and the repository. Also, synchronizes the Ownership/Access information with the Authentication/Authorization module.
Metadata Administration
    Responsible for the metadata structure ingested into the system such as; fields, data types and object’s ownership.
Authentication/ Authorization 
    Authenticates several access portals and limits their access to the objects owned by the specified access portal, thereby allowing several access portals to host their content on the same repository.
Media Ingester 
    Receives the SIP (Submission Information Package) from the media sources and converts it to its AIP (Archival) form.
Storage Cluster
    The multimedia storage system consists of:
      •	Storage servers
      •	Replication/recovery tool
      •	Load balancer/ Storage resolver
      •	Access API
Media Access Portal  
    The portal on which users can access the media hosted on the system.
Copyright Engine
    Verifies whether the object is to be released or not according to the BA’s copyright regulations.
Players/Viewer Engine

Librarians working with geospatial information are crucial partners in the research discovery process for scholars engaged in critical geography. A number of libraries and archival repositories have taken great steps to increase the discoverability, usability, and preservation of  of geospatial information through the creation of geographic information retrieval systems, colloquia that enhance skill-building with geospatial platforms, and collaborations that encourage more centralized resources for spatial discovery.

In spite of these efforts, researchers and librarians have yet to  harness the profound possibilities of  engaging critical geography alongside delivery of geospatial resources.

",A key aspect of preparing librarians to deal with the complex problems of sustaining cultural resources in digital forms is learning about the systems that support digital preservation. This session considers how development environments like Vagrant and Docker may be employed as the basis for such training.,,,,,"Tomer, Christinger",University of Pittsburgh,United States of America,North_America, ,ctomer@pitt.edu,christomer@icloud.com,ctomer@pitt.edu,"Tomer, Christinger",ctomer@pitt.edu,,,0,"It has been observed recently that “information technology as a center of work in libraries appears to be stalled somewhere along the transition from the marginal to the central.”[1] One of the many consequences of this state  of affairs is that many librarians are not prepared to deal with the complex problems of sustaining cultural resources in digital forms, and this problem is compounded by the fact that most of the people entering the
information professions today are not prepared to work effectively with the technologies that are central to the curation or preservation of digital resources.  So, it seems reasonable to propose that training librarians to deal more effectively with information technology in general, and in particular with the information technologies associated with the curation
and preservation of digital resources, is matter of considerable importance.

A key question is how this training will be done, and there are, of course, a variety of options available. The session proposed herein will describe how two development environments, Vagrant and Docker, may be used as a basis for teaching and learning about the systems and tools essential to the curatorial and preservation processes, and how this approach may be tailored to meet the specific circumstances and training requirements of
individual organizations. (Vagrant is a software tool that simplifies the workflow and reduces the workload necessary to run and operate virtual machines on a computer, by offering a simple command-line interface to manage virtual machines, supporting all major virtualization solutions and configuration tools, and providing procedures to distribute and share virtual environments. Also included in the coverage is Packer, a command-line tool that automates the creation of pre-installed virtual machines, in the form of Vagrant boxes, for various operating systems and providers. Docker is a platform designed to manage Linux container technology, primarily through portable images and an easy-to-interpret interface. The Docker platform has two principal components: the Docker Engine, which is used to create and run containers; and the Docker Hub, a cloud service for distributing containers. Docker Compose, a tool that uses YAML files for building and running applications composed of multiple Docker containers, will also be treated.[2]) The main idea behind the use of these development environments is that each of them provides significant degrees of adaptability and flexibility. For example, through the use of Packer it is possible to build a virtual machine image that is configured in accord with local configurations and operating requirements so that training occurs under circumstances almost identical to those obtaining for production systems. e.g., roles and workflows customized to reflect local conditions and/or needs. Copies of the Vagrant boxes containing such virtual images can distributed to trainees for installation on their personal computers and updated as often as is necessary. Under Docker, Linux containers can be configured similarly, and those containers can be distributed and updated via Docker Hub. The advantage to learners is that they can have the software installed on a personal computer, and they can learn about the design and functions of the systems at issue within formal training settings or on a more personal basis, or both.

Specific examples and demonstrations will entail systems such as Archivematica, running as a Vagrant box, and DSpace, as a Linux container managed by Docker. Depending on the time allotted, other examples may include systems such as Callimachus, ArchivesSpace, and AToM.

These workflows incorporate three leading open source software (OSS) platforms - BitCurator, Archivematica and ArchivesSpace - and the project is producing findings that can also be generalizable to settings that are using other platforms and applications.  

Libraries and archives increasingly bear responsibility for stewardship of born-digital materials, and implementing workflows to support this stewardship is a pressing and persistent challenge. Curating these assets involves a variety of functions (acquisition, description, preservation, access provision) that no single system can manage. Institutions must work within their existing processes, policies, institutional constraints, and technical platforms to develop workflows that combine tools to support local needs. A single turnkey system does not exist and is unlikely to in the future. 

Despite the popularity of OSS tools, most institutions have not yet implemented more than one simultaneously. In particular, few small-to-midsized libraries have undertaken multiple simultaneous implementations. The complications in connecting and integrating tools can be major barriers to implementation. Several recent “proof of concept” projects have investigated OSS tool integration, but have done so as single pathways within single institutional contexts only. These projects successfully raised awareness of possibilities for integrating OSS tools. Realizing those possibilities requires researching, devising, testing and documenting various strategies for implementing workflows within institutions of multiple sizes and types. 

The research in this project is supporting digital curation in a broadened range of institutional environments with 12 partners, including public libraries, HBCU libraries, research libraries, a historical society, and liberal arts college libraries, to ensure the availability of born-digital materials for future researchers. In this panel, we will share several exciting research developments, including:

1. our preliminary analysis of the specific sociotechnical factors that act as drivers in workflow creation in our partner institutions, which include Duke University, Atlanta University Center, Kansas Historical Society, MIT, the Washington DC Public Library, NYPL, and Mt. Holyoke College;
2. examples of the workflow diagrams we are producing in the project (and an invitation to our audience to use and help us refine the basic skeleton/workflow design process we're using in order to promote more institutional comparisons and sharing);
3. examples of the eccentricities and similarities we're seeing across these 12 environments as they pursue their workflow creation and how they might influence their real-life implementations, including scripts associated with various handoff scenarios.

We will close with an audience-led discussion about what findings are of most interest (and greatest need) to their own institutional environments. We will invite audience members to share their own workflow development stories and think together about how we might ensure that our findings are helpful to them (and perhaps vice-versa) as they pursue their local implementations.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,Thanks so much for your consideration!,,,,2017--2200:00,,0

This presentation will share the findings of The Realities of Research Data Management, an OCLC Research project, which explores the context and choices research universities face in building or acquiring RDM capacity. Findings are derived from detailed case studies of four research universities in four distinct national contexts: University of Edinburgh (UK), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (US), Monash University (Australia), and Wageningen University and Research (Netherlands). Our first report, A Tour of the Research Data Management Service Space, provides background on RDM’s emergence as an important new service area supporting 21st century scholarship, and offers a model for understanding the RDM service space today. Three forthcoming reports in fall 2017 will explore specific aspects of RDM capacity acquisition: scoping the local RDM service bundle, incentives for acquiring RDM capacity, and sourcing and scaling RDM solutions – all in the context of our four case study partners. Our DLF session will present and synthesize findings from all four reports, and will provide attendees with insight on the practical realities of research data management, focusing on the key inflection points in the RDM capacity acquisition process: deciding to act, deciding what to do, and deciding how to do it.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--2200:00,,0

These oral histories were initially collected and incorporated into a website as part of a class assignment for a course titled, “The American War in Vietnam,” developed by USC Professor and Pulitzer Prize Winner, Viet Thanh Nguyen. 

In this unique approach to course design and student scholarship, the students were charged with contributing to a website which profiles and commemorates witnesses of the war through oral history interviews. The goals of the course were to create a resource that the students can use in their own studies, can be shared with the public, and be used by future researchers.  

The best practices of collecting oral history interviews, as defined by The Oral History Association, expects a commitment to preservation and access. At the Digital Library, we aim to uphold this commitment by providing a stable environment for these oral histories. We developed a workflow to capture the videos and accompanying information from the original website with the assistance of student workers and ingested them into ContentDM—our digital library platform.

We envision this project as an example for faculty professors to consider – where the USC Digital Library play’s an active role in making their students’ work available and accessible.

At the University of ________, librarians, faculty, and graduate students are developing a shared reflective practice where we consider our collective and individual relationships to technology. Through a variety of activities outside the traditional classroom, we challenge and support one another as we conceptualize what it means to be a 21st century scholar. Our pedagogical interventions use discussions of metacognitive problems such as “how can I develop a system for organizing my research photos that is sustainable for me, given what I know about my abilities and inertia?” and “I have two digital tools in hand that do about the same thing, how can I tell which one is better suited, not only to my research question, but also to my habits and preferred approaches as a scholar?” 

During a series of voluntary workshops called “toolshops,” we explored tools for teaching and research using conceptual frames such as collaboration, circuits, and adventure, as well as practical hooks such as image management and project management. We have explored our physical relationship to computers by prying apart a hard drive and making drawings of machines and tools, exploring the line between computerized and not. 

We have also produced, as a collaborative effort between librarians and faculty, a term-long, studio-based learning environment for digitally-engaged graduate students that we hope to make part of a formal certificate in Digital Studies and Methods. The pedagogical goals of this exercise are focused on scaffolding the creation of individual digital humanities projects within a production-focused, collaborative, group setting. Each member of the cohort, including the seminar leaders, relied on one another to gain expertise with the diversity of digital tools needed to produce the projects on hand. We found that there is a critical need for students to be proactively shown how they might express their thoughts and ideas in, through, and about technical systems.

Throughout all of these experiences, we have allowed time for extended individualized consultation, and cultivated both open-ended inquiry and acute problem-solving. We aim to make space for students to articulate needs not proactively met in the classroom, and to make connections with those outside their home discipline. As a result, students build relationships with a network of practitioners on campus and beyond. 

During this 60 minute panel we will facilitate a discussion among panelists and the audience, considering the following questions:
How are librarians and digital humanists already facilitating metacognition among students, and is this a role we can expand?
What is the value in developing a reflective practice outside the classroom? Should it become part of coursework?
Are there other ways to leverage a librarian’s wide angle lens, noticing patterns in contemporary academic work?
How can we incorporate metacognition into our teaching practice, as we reflect on our own relationship to digital tools and methods?",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--2200:00,,0

Now, in 2017, we - both as professionals and consumers - seem to have every reason to believe in the inevitable progress of information media formats and interfaces. We are routinely reminded of the grave dangers found in letting our media formats, accessibility standards, and IT infrastructures fall into obsolescence. Likewise, the sometimes uneasy relationship between more traditional memory institutions and new information services (e.g., Google) puts librarians on the defensive, as we struggle to keep up with technological advancements driven by players with no vested interest in our distinguishing professional roles or ethics. Consequently, libraries dedicate a great deal of time and effort to mass digitization projects, managing electronic collections, crosswalking metadata, shopping for DAMs, upgrading, migrating, and otherwise making sure our systems and content are as cutting-edge as time and budgets allow.

Yet, around the world, millions of high school and college students are choosing to connect with each other via Telnet accessible BBSs and barebones imageboards in lieu of services like Facebook or Twitter. They capture their memories with newly manufactured, Polaroid-style instant cameras. For record companies, releasing music on cassette tape and vinyl is proving to be more than a passing hipster fad. Hip-hop producers and filmmakers fight it out on eBay over computers and toy instruments from decades past. 8-bit video game systems are once again a hot commodity, and not only for the nostalgia market. Librarians and educators are still waiting for solid evidence supporting the adoption of e-books over print material in their collections and classrooms. IRC remains a go-to tool for software developers, engineers, and hackers born well after most users switched to ""better"" chat platforms and protocol. Programming languages widely thought dead in the early 1980s continue on as avant-garde tools for live digital music and video performance.

What do these trends mean for libraries and archives? Why worry about keeping cassette tapes after digitization? What happens if we replace the ""Ask a Librarian"" widget on our website with an IRC channel? Could Telnet BBSes become the hot new virtual learning environment in 2018? Is a public web interface necessary for your institution's digital repository? Is ""user-friendliness"" really so friendly to users? What do you get when you cross an inexperienced student intern from the Art History department with a Linux command line and pile of dodgy Python scripts?

In-house digitization projects are a possibility for some cultural memory institutions, but most lack staff with specialized audiovisual training and/or funds to create a digitization facility. Furthermore, the legacy hardware required to read various audiovisual carriers gets harder to find with each passing year. The reality is that partnerships with external audiovisual digitization vendors are a necessity for the majority of cultural memory institutions and there is an immediate need for relevant educational resources.

The Effective Outsourcing with Audiovisual Digitization Service Providers panel will address this problem directly by creating a dialogue between representatives from audiovisual digitization vendors (both for-profit and nonprofit) and DLF members. The panel will also include an institutional perspective brought by a representative from a cultural memory organization that has worked with digitization vendors. Together these speakers will discuss common hurdles faced by institutions, as well as strategies for effective partnerships. Of course, vendor representatives will also receive input from DLF members regarding how best to meet their needs.

2. Moderated discussion
3. Q&A

The lightning talks will have vendor representatives discuss types of services, as well as typical projects and clients.

The moderated discussion will cover some of the community’s broad concerns (“How do I identify a ‘qualified’ service provider?” “What is the difference between parallel and one-to-one transfer?”). A survey will be sent to DLF members in advance, so that the moderated discussion can best represent their needs.

There are three vendor representatives that have agreed to be on the panel: Jan Jones (Memnon Archiving Services), Bryce Roe (Northeast Document Conservation Center) and Bob Strauss (The MediaPreserve). These speakers were chosen in order to demonstrate a wide variety of services and perspectives. For instance, Memnon is currently partnered with Indiana University and performing large scale parallel transfer for IU’s Media Digitization & Preservation Initiative, while NEDCC is a non-profit that has recently opened up an audio digitization facility that performs one-to-one transfers. The institutional representative has not been finalized at this point, but candidates from DLF member institutions are being contacted.

Our current model, based on github, prose.io and Jekyll, allows us to get student and faculty involvement with minimal technical barrier. On a practical level, this stack is easily reproducible since relatively few resources are required.

At the same time, questions necessarily arise as we invite others to participate. Why not use Omeka or Wordpress or other tools that are likely to be more recognizable? What role does our desire to use tools with which we are familiar play when deciding what to use? What are the tradeoffs of privileging notions of stability, interoperability and technological minimalism over comfortable interfaces, extensive user communities and fine-grained account management?

“What is the user asking for?”, the question at the foundation of any reference request, is often reframed in the context of DH services as “what do I already know that can help with this request?” This shift is important not only because it shifts the focus from user to provider but also because this shift reveals something about collaborative DH projects, that such projects reflect a complex negotiation between participants’ values.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--2200:00,,0

BACKGROUND: In 2012, the Association of Research Libraries’ Board of Directors authorized the establishment of the ARL Position Description (PD) Bank.  The system was developed by the library community of practice of human resources professionals, with input from over 20 ARL member institutions, and leadership by a library team at UF.  Designed as a digital collection to describe the work of library employees, interns, and other affiliates, the ARL PD Bank now contains over 1,700 position records for librarians, other professionals, support and paraprofessionals, and others.  As a shared community platform, the system relies on descriptive metadata, submitted and maintained by each institution, for the position records. Position records are searchable and accessible by that metadata: Fulltime equivalency (FTE) level; Position status (filled, open, or discontinued); Position type (professional librarian; support or paraprofessional; other professional; or other); Appointment type (regular; tenure accruing or permanent; temporary/time limited; or residency/fellowship/internship); Library type; and Functional areas (39 listed, and most positions identify more than one).

Working together, these contributing institutions, hubs, and DPLA are increasing access to materials documenting traditionally underrepresented groups through a range of highly collaborative, community-based partnerships. Through presentations and discussion, this session will highlight a selection of hub projects:
 
The Atlanta University Center (AUC) Woodruff Library serves a consortium of HBCUs including Morehouse College, Spelman College, Clark Atlanta University and Interdenominational Theological Center.  Collections from the Library’s Archives Research Center preserve the histories of the AUC, which is paramount to research on HBCUs and African American life and culture. The Library is partnering with Spelman, Morehouse, and the Digital Library of Georgia on a mass digitization project to make accessible photographs and printed and published materials from all AUC institutions. 
  
Umbra Search makes African American history more broadly accessible through a freely available search tool, umbrasearch.org; digitization of African American materials across University of Minnesota collections; and support of students, educators, artists, and the public through residencies, workshops, and events locally and around the country. To date, umbrasearch.org has brought together more than 500,000 digitized materials from over 1,000 libraries and archives across the country.

The Metropolitan New York Library Council (METRO) is an organization where New York’s libraries and archives come together to learn, share ideas, and collaborate. METRO works closely with our membership to expose and share the full history and culture of New York City whether held in large private universities or small community archives.   

The strength of the North Carolina Digital Heritage Center is its partners - over 214 cultural heritage institutions in North Carolina have shared thousands of items for digitization through DigitalNC.org. During the last year, NCDHC staff and its partners have been working to better represent the diversity of North Carolina communities and populations on the site. This evolving process has been full of rewards, with new partnerships as well as new challenges.

Panelists will offer brief presentations followed by a Q&A period with questions from the moderator and the audience. Questions from the moderator will allow panelists to explore challenges they’ve faced, technological approaches, outreach and community partnerships, the role of DPLA and the hubs network, and the potential for bringing DPLA’s national collection to bear in efforts to increase the diversity of materials, perspectives, representations, and experiences in digital libraries.

ArcLight’s community-focused design process ran from late 2014 to early 2017, and was led by Stanford with contributions from University of Michigan, the Chemical Heritage Foundation, Georgia Tech, and the National Library of Medicine. The design process followed a user-centered approach, and focused on discovery through stakeholder engagement and user interviews; development of the project’s information architecture through user needs and requirements analysis, persona development, and wireframes; and visual design. Following the design phase, Stanford built a minimum viable product in collaboration with University of Michigan and advisory contributions from a number of other domain experts in archives, from institutions including Michigan’s Bentley Historical Library, Georgia Tech, the National Library of Medicine, and the Rockefeller Archive Center.

Our minimum viable product, or MVP is based on prereleases of Blacklight 7.0.0 and Bootstrap 4, with initial support for archival description expressed in EAD 2002. The ArcLight MVP includes support for collection- and component-level discovery, faceted searching, integrated digital object presentation, and basic integration with systems for request management. Following the MVP implementation phase, Stanford is working in collaboration with the National Library of Medicine and University of Michigan to undertake accessibility testing.

However, the way in which we describe and represent digital collections is impacted by the different communities and disciplines that create those collections. In particular, there are fundamental differences in the way that libraries, archives, and museums approach representing and describing materials. Traditionally, this has created segregated repositories of content - silos - requiring users to identify and understand multiple resources in order to search comprehensively. In order to find the common ground necessary to eliminate these silos, we have to understand why our descriptive practices differ. With this understanding, we can build systems and practices that enable us to manage and deliver those materials in a comprehensible manner without sacrificing the best practices of our separate disciplines.

 
Several current initiatives make this discussion especially compelling right now and suggest multiple avenues to continue the conversation we hope to begin at DLF, including the IMLS National Digital Platform efforts aimed at ""bridging gaps between disparate pieces of existing digital infrastructure;"" the development of Hyku, a repository application for cultural heritage content; and efforts by DPLA to improve collection context and discovery for the millions of items aggregated there.  
 
This panel will discuss three different models of representing and describing materials – the archival collection-based perspective, the museum object-based perspective, and the library bibliographic perspective – and explore how effectively we are representing those models online, how that impacts users, and how we can work together to design better platforms, tools, and descriptive practices. We will discuss efforts aimed at developing better representation of heterogeneous collections online, and consider how we can make improvements in workflows, organizational structure, interfaces, and software to better represent and deliver our myriad collections.

Last year, the Fedora community embarked on an effort to specify the Fedora REST-API. The specification, scheduled to be finalized in 2017, will serve as a contract that guarantees a specific set of services and behaviours for any implementation of Fedora. Along with this effort, community members are working on alternate Fedora implementations; different back-end applications that implement the Fedora API specification to respond to different use cases. Taken together, these initiatives will allow the Fedora project to adapt to technological change more easily over time while insulating clients from changes in the underlying implementation.

In a related effort, the Fedora community has developed a utility for importing and exporting resources to and from Fedora, along with exporting Fedora resources to external preservation systems, such as DPN, APTrust, and MetaArchive. As Fedora goes through upgrades and changes over time this utility will make it easier to migrate data using standard formats and protocols.

I believed that experiencing childhood poverty, taking more than a handful of classes in African American Studies as an undergraduate, and consciously cultivating a healthy stock of liberal sensitivity mitigated - at least in part - the impact of my own privilege, among other bad ideas.

After living as a research assistant in East Asia for a number of years, I thought fitting in at my first professional position - metadata librarian for Alabama A&M University - would be mostly unchallenging. After all, I was technically well prepared by education and experience, generally open minded, and long accustomed to being the only ""white guy"" in my office.  I was also wrong.

This lightning talk will recount a few personally significant lessons, embarrassing moments, and uncomfortable revelations - both humorous and serious - from my time working at AAMU, as an expression of gratitude for the colleagues with whom I worked, and whose generous hospitality and patient understanding allowed me to plumb the depth of my own ignorance.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--2200:00,2017--2200:00,0

Over the past few years, the University of Michigan Library IT (LIT) division has embarked on a massive culture change effort in an attempt to improve cross-team collaboration, transparency, and efficiency by adopting a shared suite of tools. This effort has been made significantly more difficult in part due to the large size of the LIT division (58 FTE) and more complex due to its close collaboration with HathiTrust, which contains 8 people centrally and an additional 30-40 people from partner institutions who need to have access to new tools. The number of individuals involved, the many different team cultures, and our diverse organizational cultures means that every small change needs to be carefully considered before implementation. 

Our first step was to develop a cross-department LIT Tools Committee (including a a HathiTrust representative) that worked to define our needs and propose an implementation plan. The rollout of the first tool, Slack, provided valuable lessons into learning how to implement a new tool into a complex culture. We have then proceeded with implementing several Atlassian tools (Confluence, Service Desk, and Software) which has been a substantially more challenging  process.

Reflecting on the nature of the partnership is key to understanding the success of the research. Various conceptual models exist for describing interdisciplinary collaboration, and library services in digital humanities; by sharing individualized narratives we will examine the partnerships and networks that emerge from new questions and tools. 

The book examines the concepts and pressures that create and foster the relationships. New questions are revealed through technologies used in the digital humanities. Is the tool prompting new questions? Or are questions prompting new tools? What can we learn from exploring these questions together as faculty, staff, and librarians? We have documented the current environment while prompting new questions, research paths, and pedagogical methods that wouldn’t have been possible before.

It is a community-based solution that leverages existing, widely used standards whenever possible to ensure long-term sustainability. Over the past year, Fedora community members have collaborated on a utility for importing and exporting content to and from Fedora using standard formats and protocols. This utility can facilitate a larger digital preservation solution where content is both stored in Fedora and exported to long-term digital preservation systems and services such as DPN, APTrust, and MetaArchive.

Purdom Lindblad - University of Maryland
In collaboration with the University of Maryland Library and the School of Information, Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) hosted an interdisciplinary panel of researchers, archivists, and conservators on the risks, responsibilities, and preservation strategies for endangered cultural data. The panel was followed by a hands-on workshop dedicated to personal data preservation practices.

At BC Libraries, the Digital Scholarship Group and Scholarly Communications departments co-sponsored a data rescue event for NEH and IMLS datasets. We focused on these agencies as there had not been as coordinated of an effort for humanities-related data. Working with UPenn’s instance of CKAN, we ingested metadata from IMLS & NEH grants into DataRefuge. In addition to connecting with national data rescue efforts, we discussed how local library structures, such as our Dataverse instance and institutional repository, can support endangered data.

This past year has seen the emergence of nascent collaborations that have organically evolved from working group projects and community engagement. The AIG is at a transitional moment in which its foundational work continues to grow while also providing a platform for supporting external partnerships/initiatives.

The first part of this session will review the work that took place during 2017, with presentations from six working groups in the areas of web analytics, cost assessment, cultural assessment metadata assessment, user experience, and content reuse. The presentations will be followed by a facilitated discussion on how emerging collaborations and future partnerships can positively shape digital library assessment work moving forward. 

Working group presentations will feature the following:
- The Web Analytics working group will provide updates on continuing to build, update, and expand the Annotated Resources List, first created and shared in 2016. 
- The Cost Assessment working group will share updates on efforts to evaluate the Digitization Cost Calculator user experience and to gather more data for the project. 
- The Cultural Assessment working group will present updates related to their collaboration with the User Experience subgroup (part of the User Studies working group), the publication of the initial draft of their annotated bibliography, and the development of a cultural assessment toolkit. 
- The Metadata Assessment working group will update the community on multiple projects underway, including: work on a generalized framework for digital libraries descriptive metadata assessment; a clearinghouse of metadata application profiles and mappings; an expanded database of tools used for metadata assessment; and a curriculum and workshop for metadata staff to perform (primarily) descriptive metadata assessment using a common set of tools and techniques.
- The Reuse subgroup (part of the User Studies working group) will share the work they are doing for “Developing a Framework for Measuring Reuse of Digital Objects,” an IMLS National Leadership in Libraries grant funded project (LG-73-17-0002-17). Their portion of the presentation will provide an overview of grant activities and share results from a preliminary survey that seeks to understand current practices around reuse.
- The User Experience subgroup (part of the User Studies working group) will present updates on the development of a web resource where digital library practitioners can find best practices and resources for creating user personas.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--2200:00,,0

At Carnegie Mellon University, we are examining various methods for extracting item-level metadata from digital records automatically using combined computational methods. This is an interdisciplinary and interdepartmental research project that is focused on providing automated metadata solutions for archivists, digital humanists, and other similar professionals.
 
In 2016, we began our research in this area while evaluating and assessing our digital object metadata as part of a larger repository migration. We have over 3 million pages of items in our digital collections that have inaccurate and inconsistent metadata. Our goal is to use computational methods and tools such as optical character recognition, regular expressions, topic modeling, and natural language processing to build an efficient workflow, which will allow us to automate portions of the revision and enrichment processes for our digital object metadata. The workflow we are developing focuses on creating “templates” for loose categories of objects in our digital collections, based on the genre, form, and other characteristics of the items.
 
We are currently testing our methodology on one of our smaller digitized collections––the William W. Cooper Collection––consisting of 2,885 objects. Ultimately, we hope to share our workflow, code, and any other resulting tools and technologies with the wider community via our GitHub repository.

Denert and Lohr, in their paper about building a software museum, think that actually installing a program on a computer where it can be run and used interactively by visitors is an approach that will never work. In his commentary to their work, Bauer concludes that “museum visitors should not be immediately confronted with sophisticated equipment. Instead, they should have the opportunity to play with objects such as pieces of wood.” Bearman dismisses the idea of keeping old equipment running, writing “fortunately,” no serious investment in the solution of preserving obsolete hardware and software has been attempted. Rothenberg notes that although keeping older computer equipment alive “exudes a certain technological bravado,” it is ultimately “hopelessly labor-intensive and ultimately infeasible.”
Faced with this discouraging analysis, here I am, helping the engineers at LCM+L keep these vintage computers running this legacy software, so that visitors can play with this sophisticated equipment. Bearman is now proved wrong, as LCM+L is making a “serious” attempt at this solution, although admittedly these efforts do exude technological bravado.
It’s fortunate that the engineers and archivists LCM+L did not read these analyses, but rather set about figuring out how to keep vintage computers alive for our visitors to use. The philosophical or postmodern questions that arise in academic conversations (How much of a vintage computer can you replace with new hardware or emulations before it is no longer the same vintage computer? How authentic is the experience? What does it all mean, anyway?) are less of a concern for LCM+L. We favor pragmatic goals -- How to keep this thing running? How to get the timesharing operating systems to work? What other software can we provide on these computers? How to provide manuals and quick start guides to help visitors enter into the experience of using old computing machinery? 
This introduction will be followed by an online demonstration, logging into some of our vintage computers such as the CDC 6500 running NOS 1.3, DEC 2065 running TOPS-10, VAX-11/785 running OpenVMS 7.3, PDP-11/70 running UNIX v7, and a Sigma-9 running CP-V.

We’ve used the model as a basis to build tools together by making all facets of our project hold equal weight, defining our resources so that we can learn from one another, and emphasizing a feedback cycle for continued improvement.

While hackathons bring many groups together, their primary focus is on coding. Hack/docs are focused on community building: they allow non-coders to participate more fully in a highly technical event and coders to participate more closely in the design and documentation process.  In our hack/docs, we have gathered front-end developers, programmers, systems administrators, archivists, librarians, and administrators to analyze and contribute to solving various coding problems and building new functionality. Our wide variety of perspectives have helped improve user stories, made scoping easier, and allowed new ideas to flow more easily into the coding process.

Learning outcomes
In this workshop, participants will:
1. Learn what a hack/doc event can do to foster and enhance their coding projects;
2. Work on identifying resources, partner, and problem analysis pairings for a discrete topic;
3. Create worksheets for setup and documentation of such critical features as local resources, problem facets, and platforms;
4. Think critically about ways in which this type of participatory event can break down possible barriers between organizational groups, and consider the long-term benefits of working collaboratively in an inclusive environment.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--2200:00,,0

Users, whether of libraries or other entities, are increasingly being tracked and quantified using techniques that they cannot reasonably be expected to understand, and about which they thus cannot be expected to informedly answer questions of consent. This presents a significant challenge for advocacy work and policy making related to data governance and data sovereignty.

Despite existing regulatory and cultural pushes towards data openness, there are a variety of issues related to how data are made available, re-used, or re-combined that require careful consideration. These issues include managing anonymity, privacy and informed consent; collecting, managing, and storing sensitive data; and controlling data access. Though these issues arise in a variety of different contexts, they often share several traits: 

1. They require a high level of technical literacy to understand, and are therefore difficult to communicate to users, participants, and stakeholders.

2. They are often counterintuitive even to individuals who are technically literate, and thus are difficult to address safely and consistently.

3. Users, participants, and stakeholders often have perceptions and expectations (whether accurate or not) about them.

This panel comprises four current postdoctoral Fellows with the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR). The four panelists are researchers from the USA and Canada who are working in diverse areas relating to data governance and ethics:

- The management and preservation of research data that contains confidential, sensitive, and protected information
- Writing policies for, and consulting with, indigenous peoples about datasets that they have generated
- Enabling data mining approaches on library usage data without inadvertently undermining users' privacy
- Documenting and publishing federally-funded data

Our oral histories will include thoughts on creating research lifecycle workflows, institutional repository platform migration, and technical or ethical questions around digital preservation of interactive datasets as we’ve experienced them through the evolution of the program.

These integrations occur at a variety of levels from embedded librarians, to the customization of tools for classroom use, to single in-class workshops. This presentation will briefly highlight three models for different levels of collaboration with examples and lessons learned.   

The most resource-intensive approach we’ve tried is embedded librarianship. In the Making of Modern America (newdeal.oucreate.com), we were involved from the course’s inception to its implementation. During the semester, librarians led weekly workshops for the students on research methods and tools to give them the skills to perform original research and create Omeka exhibits. 

In the next model, the DSL works with faculty to design or customize a tool for classroom use. The approach concentrates its efforts before the course begins. For example, the DSL collaborated with a Microbiology professor to create an electronic lab notebook built on Drupal. 

The final model is having a librarian offering a standalone workshop teaching students how to use pre-existing tools. For example, we have offered sessions on video creation and editing for a Social Work course and on the web annotation tool, hypothes.is, for an English course.

In addition to communication and time management techniques, we learned the importance of creating a supportive community of peers, faculty, and librarians; teaching students how to learn technology rather than a specific technology; and creating re-useable curricula.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--2200:00,,0

Like many digital repository teams, ours followed a winding path in building a workflow that was flexible enough to handle materials diverse in content and format, and sturdy enough to do so without requiring overly frequent modifications. SwamPy employs a simple configuration-based protocol for defining collections that allows us to nimbly build new collections while iteratively updating existing ones, without code changes.

Our scrum-based digital repository team has developed this suite of tools based on the needs of our own team, but also in the hope of producing functionality not limited to them. A particularly salient feature: SwamPy allows for batch replace of object datastreams by collection, which has aided in a repository-wide metadata normalization project, the deployment of JSON-LD for search engine optimization, and the addition of supplementary data files to our ETD collection. Aside from ingest functionality, the tool supports the creation of audio, image, and text derivatives (e.g. thumbnail files, OCR and hOCR text, mp3 derivatives, etc.), automated update of our Solr index by namespace, and a job queuing system including a dashboard to monitor progress.

The digitization for access model combined with the need for adequate metadata for discovery has prompted GLAM institutions to pursue crowdsourcing initiatives to enrich their collections. Furthermore, crowdsourcing has been theorized as engendering a diverse user base and new modes for users to engage with an organization’s holdings and its operations. And while crowdsourcing provides enormous potential for institutions to add value to their collections through volunteerism it by no means eliminates all effort on the part of the institution. In addition to organizational support for implementing and maintaining a project, certain processes in the crowd’s workflow may require significant internal resources. Different crowdsourcing workflows require organizational intervention at different points, and this presentation aims to individuate and examine the primary workflows employed by GLAMs for crowd transcription.

Encouraged by the U-M Library strategic plan, we wanted to find a meaningful way for Library IT staff to participate in these important conversations. In May 2016, we created the Library IT Tech Diversity Reading Club. The Reading Club had two goals:

1. To provide a safe & welcoming opportunity to talk about diversity & inclusion issues as they affect staff in Library IT
2. To gather ideas for how Library IT might address our diversity & inclusion challenges

Over the past year, the group has met monthly for an hour to discuss articles related to the lack of women in IT, running more inclusive meetings, the importance of being an ally, disability advocacy, tone policing, universal design, and codes of conduct. In addition to these discussions, the group has also engaged with the Library’s Diversity & Inclusion Specialist for advice on incorporating DEI work into Library IT staff’s personal goals.

Given that many libraries are not the only unit exploring makerspace initiatives at their university, presenters will share tips for identifying your library’s role in the maker community. Plenty of time will be included for questions and discussion among all participants. 

Case study one: Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU)

In fall 2015, the Innovative Media department of VCU Libraries opened a 3500-sf multimedia production and makerspace called The Workshop to support the university community in creating and sharing knowledge “in ways other than text.” Through equipment lending, hands-on creative technologies such as a laser cutter and sewing machines, audio and video studios, a gaming/VR room, multimedia workstations, and the expert support of a dedicated and curious staff, The Workshop provides access to as wide a range of creative and emerging technologies as possible.

Case study two: Indiana University Bloomington (IU)

In spring 2016, librarians at IU developed a mobile maker cart and designed programming to support digital creativity and hands-on learning. Through a series of workshops, students explored topics such as virtual reality, stop-motion animation, and digital music. After careful consideration of space, equipment, and instruction, students were encouraged to discover new skills on their own terms.

Like many large institutions, the library maker cart is just one of several makerspace initiatives at IU. The IU Libraries have made a conscious effort to offer unique experiences that complement, but do not duplicate, existing services on campus. This case study will offer tips for finding your library’s place in the maker movement.

Case study three: University of California, Riverside (UCR)

In spring 2017, the Creat’R Lab at UCR made its debut in the Orbach Science Library. The lab is the result of a library partnership with the Office of Research and Development, which led to not one but three library spaces dedicated to maker initiatives: a 3D printing lab, entrepreneurship mentoring room, and the Creat’R Lab itself. Preparation and planning for these three spaces was limited given time constraints of the makerspace funding, which meant that librarians were tasked with figuring out a lot of the details on the fly after the space was open to students and staff (both a fun and terrifying prospect!). This talk will highlight the challenges and opportunities of a new makerspace from the perspective of a librarian with no previous makerspace experience.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--2200:00,,0

We are building our local preservation repository primarily to support non-book collections, so we had to find a way to contribute locally-scanned books to HathiTrust.

We already had book scanning equipment and trained staff, but sending large batches of page image files to Hathi is cumbersome and taxing to local IT infrastructure and staffing which both need to be focused elsewhere. So, in the summer of 2016, we purchased two TableTop Scribe scanners and developed a workflow to contribute digitized books to HathiTrust vis-à-vis the Internet Archive. This workflow bypasses OSUL’s local infrastructure by pushing page image files and metadata directly to the Internet Archive for post-processing and hosting (for a fee per page). Once in the Internet Archive, our digitized books and their metadata are pulled into HathiTrust. Having our locally scanned books in both repositories (IA and Hathi) increases their reach, and Internet Archive’s per-page “Gold Package” allows us to focus more of our resources on metadata enhancement and scanning and less on postprocessing and hosting.

To meet this goal, it is essential to collect globally, with robust variety, and to collect content created by a multiplicity of actors and organizations.

While there are different approaches to developing new international collecting modalities, UCLA Library’s IDEP (International Digital Ephemera Project) significantly reframed how we engage with our partners (from Armenia, Cuba, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, and South Africa) by using a post-custodial collecting model that we believe can have an impact across the library world – where collecting for uniqueness is valued. 

Through IDEP, we provide foundational support to our international partners by purchasing digitization equipment and providing training and ongoing support so our partners can digitize content themselves. Our approach not only provides a means for capturing specific collections or items, but it also provides an ongoing infrastructure for access and preservation for our international partners. 

Given the vast amount of content housed internationally and the imminent threats to collections in many parts of the world, the IDEP model is a highly effective approach.  

In this presentation, I will explore the challenges that we have faced in IDEP and look at the vast opportunities for expanding this model to additional partners and collections.

Do we interrogate platforms and vendor products in an information literate way? Solutions to these challenges from a library staffing and organizational structure perspective.

We’ll provide conceptual frameworks to help navigate these issues, as well as some examples of working solutions. Participants then form self-selected groups based on interest to delve deeper into sub-themes. 

Possible table themes:

Professional ethics and privacy: What are the guiding principles that should inform how we make choices?

Learning analytics and data collection: How should we measure the costs vs. benefits of systematic data collection on our users?

Working with administrators/vendors: what are some messaging techniques to communicate when talking with administrators/vendors?

Collective Action: how can libraries work together to create change in this arena?

Kicking the Tires: how do we adapt our acquisition processes to include evaluation and negotiation with vendors around issues of privacy?

Beyond digitization, in order to facilitate discovery, AV materials must also be described, but many items and collections lack sufficient metadata. Unlike textual materials, for which some degree of discovery may be provided through full-text indexing, AV materials lack detailed metadata to support their effective discovery, identification, and use by researchers, students, and instructors, or to enable rights and access decisions on the part of collections staff and cannot be found, understood, or consumed.

Islandora was originally developed by the University of Prince Edward Island's Robertson Library, but is now implemented and contributed to by an ever-growing international community. This panel will invite discussion of Islandora as a tool for creating projects that broaden access to important collections as well as an open-source community that lowers barriers to entry for small institutions developing digital library programs.

Panelists will discuss difficulties associated with developing robust, standards-based digital collections on relatively small budgets, with fewer developer resources, and recent developments in Islandora community development that aim to make adoption and maintenance of Islandora installations more attainable. They will talk about digital archives projects that engage critically with hegemonic narratives, surface lesser-heard voices in their collections, and (drawing from the work of Bergis Jules) seek to amend failures of care in archiving the legacies of marginalized people. This panel will bring together multiple threads often separated in digital library discussions: development, design, accessibility, curation, metadata, labor, and outreach. The unifying theme is Islandora; there will also be an emphasis on smaller institutions with one or fewer full-time developers on staff. Presentations will be brief to allow for an extended discussion period/breakout sessions.

Topics:

Islandora Enterprise (ISLE) is a new project in development that will address significant pain-points in Islandora: installation and maintenance. ISLE separates an institution’s customizations from core code, and moves that core code into containers that are easily updated, simplifying and largely automating the process of installation and updates/maintenance of Islandora. Islandora’s complex ecosystem makes it difficult and expensive to install, maintain and customize, but ISLE lowers the barrier to entry for new organizations while allowing existing users to reallocate funds towards development or ingestion instead of maintenance. 

The New York Academy of Medicine Library is in the process of transitioning from a ContentDM digital collection website to an Islandora solution. Like many of our colleagues, the Library has limited resources (a team of two) but a strong drive to make our collections available to the public. Working with a vendor for implementation and maintenance made it possible to design a site that can be managed by a small team. This process also highlighted the challenges of a small team as it works to build the collections for the website.

Vassar College Libraries had the opportunity to develop two distinctive oral history collections through campus partnerships, with a campus organization, the LGBTQ Center, and a course, ANTH/AFRS 386: Situating Blackness. The projects focused on capturing the experiences of former students that were not easily found in our archives, and in each case, the goal of the digital library was to make materials as widely available as possible while using our software to connect students, alums, faculty, and library. 

The University of Rochester River Campus Libraries assembled a collaborative team of Digital Humanities practitioners, a manuscript librarian, web developers, and graduate students to create the May Bragdon Diaries Project. Unlike most diaries, May had pasted inclusions (photographs, correspondence, ephemera, etc.) right on top of her manuscript, requiring a unique data model and viewer to retain their physical context. Built on Islandora, the team built a platform that immerses the user into the world of May’s diaries.

The Doctor or Doctress site uses Islandora to make history more accessible to a high school audience through guided exploration of primary source documents. Using extended description as metadata, the site encourages users to closely examine document evidence and draw their own conclusions about women in American history.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,I apologize for going over the word limit on the proposal! ,,,,2017--2200:00,2017--2300:00,0

Preserving the records of this multifarious institution is a dynamic and continuous enterprise involving advocacy, education, and collaboration among archivists, members of Congress, and institutions responsible for preservation. As the records generated by Congress are increasingly born digital, this work has become more urgent. Preservation of the large and complex digital materials produced by Congress not only requires technical expertise and early intervention, but also demands ongoing communication and informed negotiations. 

Congressional digital materials are unwieldy, encompass numerous formats, and are created and managed inconsistently. Modern congressional collections can contain formats ranging from emails and legislative text to Twitter accounts and videos. Proprietary systems managing constituent correspondence data can be exported to archival repositories and hold significant promise for research but also pose dilemmas around access and privacy. 

Congressional offices and committees may maintain digital materials in shared drives, on personal storage and mobile devices, on social media accounts, in email, and on websites. Further, materials are created by hundreds of members of Congress and thousands of staff members employed in the Senate and House of Representatives, each with their own preferences and practices for creating and organizing work product. This means that when taken together, digital and paper, or hybrid, congressional materials can be duplicative, messy, and exceptionally difficult to appraise and process. 

Dispersed ownership of the records of Congress also contributes to management challenges. Records created in congressional committees are the official records of Congress and must be transferred to the National Archives, while the materials created in the offices of members of Congress are the members’ personal property and are usually transferred to collecting repositories across the country. Donations of congressional materials often are high profile, involve numerous individuals and sometimes intricate agreements. 

To ensure the preservation of congressional digital materials, archivists working in the government and at repositories across the country recognize the importance of advocacy, education, and building relationships in addition to their technical training and expertise. Archivists who manage these expansive digital materials at various points in the records life cycle have been collaborating to improve the management, transfer, and donation of digital congressional materials. Archivists on this panel will share their experiences working with each other, with the donors and their staffs, and with other stakeholders, including information technology specialists and administrators, to build relationships that support digital preservation. They offer perspectives from different stages of the records life cycle, explore how they intersect, and share goals for future improvements.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--2200:00,,0

Broadly, the goals of the workshop and project are to address two key challenges. We call the first challenge the skills gap. While practicing mid­-career librarians are learning data science skills through programs like Data science training for librarians (DST4L) and software/data/library carpentry, but there is only so much a short, multi-day workshop can accomplish in re-defining professional identity and the work of librarianship. The effective integration of data science in libraries must address larger issues related to organizational structures, personnel management, and expectations of constituent communities. This leads to the second challenge we call the management gap. Even when practicing librarians have data science skills, they might lack opportunities to leverage these skills within the library. Library administrators need toolkits and frameworks to strategically use data science for data­-driven decision making and management of library operations.

Instead, Fedora was used primarily as a system for managing access and as a metadata database, one which had to be supplemented with other ancillary systems for managing large preservation masters or streaming audio and video files, and which was supported by workflows that saw long periods of the resource life-cycle falling outside of Fedora's control.  In building a new repository application based on the current version of Fedora, we have striven to place Fedora more firmly in the center of our preservation life-cycle. First, this required procuring sufficient storage to house large audio and video preservation masters as well as access copies and metadata.  Second, it necessitated developing workflows that would allow assets to be loaded into the repository immediately upon receipt.

rodriguezsan@umkc.edu",,,0,"We propose a panel discussion on the theme of Valuing Labor, drawing from topics of interest within the DLF Labor in Digital Libraries, Archives, and Museums Working Group. The Working Group was formed to address a need in the field for discussion and guidance on ethical issues related to labor. These issues include the widely acknowledged (in)visibility of labor in libraries and the multiplicity of labor models relied upon to build, maintain, and execute projects within digital libraries. Recognizing labor as being undervalued has long been framed as an individual concern in our field, but this panel will demonstrate that organized and collective action is required to address labor conditions at structural and organizational scales. 

Several general questions guide the focus of this panel. What does it mean to value labor across diverse digital library and museum settings and contexts? What would it look like to foreground labor in long-term digital library program building and maintenance? What are the terms of a sustainable labor ethics, and who sets those terms? Other fundamental concerns include surfacing different labor models and incentives currently in use in digital library contexts; points of friction and conflict; when and how people enter or leave the world of digital library labor; and how labor concerns manifest unevenly across roles within digital libraries. How we assign value to various modes of labor within our profession shapes the work we do, who gets to do it, and how we ultimately see (or don't see) this labor. Who maintains, repairs, and gets credit? What roles can management and labor play in ensuring workers are compensated fairly? What roles do gender and whiteness play in perceptions of labor value?

Panelists will address these questions from specific, situated experiences and perspectives related to valuing labor. We hope to highlight intersecting roles such as organized labor, managers, contingent labor, volunteers, student labor, and professional labor, to compare perspectives and facilitate discussion on how organizations might practically begin to address multiple issues simultaneously.

Each panelist brings personal and professional experience to matters of organizational change. Ruth Tillman will address challenges and guidance for formulating grant-funded and other contingent positions. Emily Drabinski will speak to how organizing around workplace grievances can change labor conditions at a structural scale. Graeme Slaght will discuss how both individual and institutional incentives reflect the value assigned to different kinds of digital library labor, especially in terms of the conditions of contingent or ""project"" work. Lisa Hinchliffe will present a reflective and ethical approach to managing and supervising pre-professional student employees in libraries. Sandy Rodriguez will address tensions inherent in supporting ""emerging"" and ""developing"" areas for libraries with contingent resources; she will also speak to how contingency and precarity can further obfuscate perceptions of value among staff of color. Melissa Chalmers will introduce research on labor structures, which include paid and unpaid labor, behind collaborative large-scale book digitization initiatives.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--2200:00,2017--2200:00,0

During this time, materials such as inventory records, correspondence, photographs, and financial records were processed, cataloged, and made available for researchers. Along with the grant for processing came other grants for transcribing the stock books and digitizing significant portions of the archive. The large size and complexity of this collection required staff from across the Institute to work together and develop creative and efficient methods for imaging, metadata creation, and rights analysis. 

This presentation will focus on some of the innovative methods we used to digitize and provide access to over 30,000 photographs of artworks that passed through the dealer’s hands throughout the 20th century. The most interesting is how we expedited the physical processing significantly, and freed up archivists to work on more complex tasks like rights research, by using information from the Getty Provenance Index and other parts of the archive to enrich the finding aid with artwork titles using OpenRefine, fancy Excel functions, and python scripting. We also developed simple shell scripts for the imaging technician to verify her own work - important considering the photographs are housed in more than 1,500 boxes!

Some university libraries have stepped up to provide storage for research data in institutional repositories. However, few libraries and archives have been proactive in working with researchers from planning for data, collecting data, creating and capturing metadata, and finding the very best home for the data once they are created. Still fewer have taken a proactive role in educating faculty, and especially graduate students, in managing their own data. Graduate students are the ideal audience to learn good data management skills and attitudes that may become habits for a lifetime. Yet, no office or organization on campuses today takes a broad and inclusive approach to data management education for all graduate students and budding researchers.

The formation of the Digital Preservation Planning Subcommittee, consisting of representatives from the four universities as well as centralized library technology support, proved a promising start.

Organizations that aggregate institutional metadata are likewise challenged to do their work without central remediation or complex technical workarounds.

This documentation can act as counter-evidence, a way of speaking back to the means and methods of evidence gathering by the state. Over the past few years, citizen documentation of fatal encounters with police have served as a catalyst for many overlapping communities, exposing the urgency of confronting police violence, the techno-utopian allure of surveillance technologies and the speed with which technologies of dissemination can disperse, disconnect and re-contextualize.

Building tools for collecting, authenticating, organizing, storing and accessing myriad forms and formats of documentation within proposes both challenges and opportunities. With instances of police violence we must confront the ways in which calls for authentication might force us to operate within the juridical framework of evidentiary value or whether we need to redefine evidentiary value in community terms. Recordings made with a smart phone are certainly personal digital records, but they immediately become embroiled in a network of legal and technological issues through the use of corporately owned infrastructures and through evidence law to name a few.
