Change may require modifications in workflow, priorities, policies, and even content. Staff members may need to be reassigned, dismissed, hired, and/or trained for new roles and responsibilities. New communication channels may need to be developed, and negotiation with administration may be key to continued funding. Legacy content may need to be transformed or migrated, and those processes developed, documented, and implemented.  Through it all, managers are likely to be challenged to both manage their own emotional reactions and to support employees as they go through their own grief processes, while still keeping the group functioning and focused on productive work.  We may have to step back from who we thought we were and where we thought we were going, to take stock and reconsider our careers even as we revise our systems, staffing, content, and directions.  Effective leadership requires diplomatic communication skills, the ability to shift focus to core functions and new directions, and empathic consideration for those impacted by the change. If we see change as a necessary part of life and as holding the potential for personal growth, it is possible to develop an appropriate response and find a positive focus even in the face of difficult transitions.

In the archival setting this is particularly true as access to the relations between documents, persons, places, and other entities is required for deep understanding to be achieved. While creating context is recognized in North American archives as a core functioning, there has been little explored as to what context actually means, how that may differ between other institutions, and how it can be recognized or assessed (Lee, 2011).  Further, how does the form it takes affect the production of meaning for users?

However, it also maintains a diverse repository landscape that has grown and shifted over the the past two decades. Owing to a number of factors, there has been very little data standardization across the multitude of digital collections. This lack of standardization, combined with the endless possibilities for field customization by curators, faculty, and collection stewards, has led to the creation of a number of “snowflake” collections: each with its own unique set of needs, data structures, and field definitions.

As the Visual Resources Metadata Librarian, my current goal is to conduct a large-scale data cleanup project across Cornell library’s digital image collections. This initiative includes identifying and analyzing 1700 unique metadata fields in order to retrofit 300,000 records across 85 collections to an application profile. This project will therefore require a great deal of negotiation with stakeholders, both internal and external to the library. 

During this presentation, I will outline my work plan for addressing this massive cleanup, demonstrate some of the tools that I am utilizing, as well as present my preliminary work towards constructing a metadata application profile. The ultimate goal of this project is to gain intellectual control over Cornell’s rich data related to its digital image collections, as well as to increase the usability of these collections by constructing better data models and facilitating a community of practice throughout the library system.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--0300:00,,0

The problem of research
We can’t complete our conservation plan of the manuscript because we must solve the problems which faced us, we have to problems 
The first one is the weak structure of this group of paper, it is very brittleness and fragility, in addition to the difficulty of handles it.
The second problem is the burning and dark appearance and blocking degradation which caused by dark appearance and lead to blocking the written text and the difficulty of read it 
The aim of research
Improve the current condition of the weak structure of the seven papers to be safely handled. Extract the written text from all the seven papers to be available for scholars and researchers and make a digital preservation step . We divided our conservation manuscript plan to three steps
First : rescue the burnet appearance paper by consolidate it and find a good way to preserve it in  appropriate enclosures in  addition to using the multi spectral imaging method to extract the disappeared written text by using multi spectral imaging method and this step is our research topic

New professionals are often challenged to connect their pre-existing skills and knowledge with internal and external stakeholder expectations. Further, there is a need to balance the digital preservation best practices and standards with institutional realities and capabilities. Each speaker will address a case study of ‘best versus good enough’ from their residency project.

Working on large-scale digital preservation requires deciding what level of adherence to best practices is ‘good enough’ to preserve an institution’s digital content, so that efforts are sustainable and scalable given the institution’s resources. In order for digital preservation programs to become sustainable, less experienced professionals need to be trained and empowered, despite often lacking the expertise to implement technical tasks considered digital preservation best practices. Processing and appraising at scale introduces a number of unique opportunities and challenges, such as automating content selection through scripting, which is a task typically reserved for trained archivists. Joe and Elizabeth will discuss creating and implementing workflows for large-scale digital collections, training staff who are often excluded from digital preservation work, and finding a balance between what is ideal versus what is acceptable.

Similar challenges arise when providing access to digital archival collections and archivists must decide how close to best practices they are able to adhere. Projects with multiple stakeholders can lead to complex requirements and competing priorities. Furthermore, at large institutions digital preservation best practices may vary between departments, with marked differences between data and archival units. For example, data specialists use ‘live’ and versioned digital objects while archives prefer static ‘snapshots.’ Meredith and Charlotte will address the complexities of creating policies for digital collections in institutions with divisions that have competing ideas of ‘good enough.’

When new policies are implemented, institutions must adjust. While policies can be beneficial in the long-term, the actual implementation takes time, especially when it creates additional work in already busy work environments. Megan and Amy will discuss their work to foster openness, collaboration, and improved digital stewardship through the development and implementation of new tools, networks, and services to support the preservation of research data. They will touch on methods used to build data management plans, a science data catalog, and new digital services, while assessing needs and fostering openness and collaboration. Of particular importance is the open invitation for collaboration and commentary; these materials are intended to be ‘good enough’ to serve the community of practice today, with the hope that best practices will develop over time through sharing, experience, and collaboration.

Through these six case studies we hope to highlight the political nature of best practices and compromise.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--0800:00,,0

From collaborations with university presses to institutional repositories to managing and publishing journals and open educational resources, libraries are supporting scholarly publishing in a number of creative ways. Libraries are uniquely positioned to play a role in campus publishing initiatives. In addition to often being considered a “neutral party,” library staff have extensive expertise in areas such as digital preservation, copyright, metadata, search engine optimization, and publishing platforms. As long term advocates for changes in scholarly communications, academic libraries have long been thinking about the skills, technologies, and logistics of exploring new publishing ventures while supporting existing ones.

For many libraries, the first step is to evaluate their existing resources and then identify possible campus partners.  This can be challenging, as the needs of campus partners may not be immediately apparent.

We provide an update on a project designed to better understand the current scholarly publishing environment at Rice. In addition to identifying publishing projects across campus, library staff conducted semi-structured ethnographic interviews with those engaged this work.

The nature of digital content and its chain of interdependencies puts this material at significant risk.

At the same time, ‘the right to be forgotten’ is an important issue that the European courts, libraries, and archives are struggling with managing. Creators have less control of their content, uploading to the web is essentially publishing. Many creators are unaware of the complex nature of publishing on the web, legal terms, and physical ownership of the bits that represent content.

Preservation and conservation are related, but distinct concepts. Similarly, levels of digital preservation represent a spectrum of way in which we can handle digital content. Curatorial choices will affect our knowledge of and exposure to personal information in our born-digital collections. These choices should be informed by a framework of professional ethics and understanding of evolving impacts. 

Too often there is a desire to grab as much content as possible to head off the digital dark age. Archivists know that over collection is a disservice to our users. Because internet users don’t always think of downstream consequences, macro approaches to preserve internet content may violate their privacy.

News applications, or interactive databases that make up some of the most sophisticated journalism stories being produced today, are one type of dynamic objects in dire need of archiving and preservation solutions. Unlike most born-digital news content, news apps rely on databases and complex layers of software to function and display. They cannot be fully captured by web archiving tools such as Archive-It, and as such, they are currently disappearing. 

This research focuses on finding a path toward capturing and archiving these data journalism stories. The first step in this process was to gain a better understanding of the number and nature of news apps being produced. This presentation will share the results of a news apps survey, which gathered data from some of the major national and international organizations producing these stories, including the Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, The Guardian, the Wall Street Journal, and ProPublica, among others. Our analysis describes the code, data, software libraries, and server environments that make up these news apps, as well as the proprietary and licensing information related to the data and editorial content. This environmental scan of news apps is, to our knowledge, the first survey of its kind, and we plan to use the results in developing recommendations for tools to capture, archive, and preserve these vital data journalism stories so that they may be accessible to future scholars.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--0900:00,,0

Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic shift away from microfilming and toward digitization and digital acquisition of copied materials.  Annually, the museum acquires between 3 to 5 million pages of digitized documents. This introduces a host of digital preservation challenges: from assessing our long-term preservation responsibility for unoriginal material to documenting the technical specifications used during digitization.         

The Museum duplicates records for a variety of reasons: lack of resources to preserve at the holding institution; willful neglect or destruction (including hostile acts); unpredictable political climates and rising antisemitism; inherent acidity and poor quality of wartime paper; and the scattering of collections due to wartime events.  In many cases, the Museum works closely with US diplomatic services in foreign countries and partner institutions -- pushing year-after-year to find the right political or administrative climate to go into repositories, survey collections, and duplicate original holdings.  Often, the door is closed after we are able to make copies.  For example, many former Soviet Archives were opened shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union, allowing the Museum to go in and duplicate collections.  Today, however, much of the material available to researchers at the Museum is now largely inaccessible from the holding repositories.      

The focus of this presentation will be on the Museum’s work to acquire Holocaust documentation; create a digital preservation decision matrix to classify the preservation requirements for “copy collections;” assess long-term digital preservation risk; and ultimately preserve these digital holding in an ever-changing geopolitical environment.

The academic subfield of critical code studies focuses on how software is not neutral in the discovery and presentation of information, but, in this presentation, we instead will explore the tension between the mission of libraries to preserve and facilitate access to cultural heritage content through digital projects while respecting the communities or individuals represented in the content. Given that the presentation of cultural heritage content online inevitably displays bias, how to present it without being exploitative is a fine line and requires librarians to be arbiters of ethical considerations. Although this theme of ethical considerations has emerged as a focus in digital library conferences fairly recently, the theme of ethical considerations as part of our profession are not new as evidenced in library science literature, especially in the archives and preservation literature of the past 30 years.

With digital preservation, we often operate in a sort of liminal zone where policy and procedures are grainy so we ought to be talking about organizational strategy more than we do.  By and large it doesn’t happen because organizational strategies are opaque with respect to digital preservation. There should be a discussion about values that guides us through that uncertainty.  But there doesn’t seem to be a significant amount of evidence of that. Instilling the ideals of a deep preservation culture requires a custodial chain that connects the following concepts: procedure; policy; strategy; and values. If you don’t know what procedure to follow refer to policy; if you don’t know what policy to follow look at organizational strategy; if you don’t know where you fit in the strategy look at the values.  If you don’t recognize the values then you are really in trouble.

These issues become amplified when one considers the possibility of using preservation services that extend beyond one’s jurisdictional boundaries. Coupling the need for security both for and against political entities makes amplifies the politics of preservation. How can we leverage global partners to place content out of harm’s way?

Now almost 35 years after the projects conclusion, memory of the study is fading as are the technologies used to preserve this subjugated knowledge.  The preservation of these materials at the Library and Archive Canada (LAC), means the oral history has largely gone unused due to complications and access costs.
Recent shifts in the social work profession, in particular neo-liberalism and austerity challenge social workers to consider what it means to be a leader in the profession, and what kinds of leadership are most likely to preserve and enhance social justice. Turning back to the history of the profession and considering the techniques and approaches used by social workers may hold utility for contemporary leaders.

A major challenge is that DACS, the official content standard of the U.S. archival community, has been slow to adapt to the increasing presence of digital material in collections. This is compounded by DACS having relationships to other standards, such as MARC and EAD, which do not always align in the context of born-digital. 

The lack of clarity and agreement in this area has resulted in a proliferation of finding aids that fail to adequately express the quality, quantity, and usability of digital material. This both diminishes accessibility and ensures that each organization must ‘re-invent the wheel’ when it comes to describing this content.

The PEGI project has been informed by a series of meetings between university librarians, information professionals, and representatives of federal agencies, including the Government Publishing Office and the National Archives and Records Administration.  There is now a growing awareness nationally of the serious ongoing loss of government information that is electronic in nature.  This issue has loomed larger in recent years, reaching a point of criticality that drove intense discussions in recent meetings of information management thought leaders from across the United States.  Summits held in April and December of 2016 sought to explore ways of undertaking urgently needed cross-sector activities to preserve and provide access to electronic government information.
This project proposes focusing on activities of triage, drilling down into agency workflows, differentiating the audiences for electronic government information, mobilizing collaborative efforts, and undertaking advocacy and outreach efforts to raise awareness of the importance of preserving digital government information.  The project will conduct a comprehensive multi-modal environmental scan of at-risk federal digital content.  Guidance documents will be produced by the PSC and project staff for agencies and other publishers of government electronic information.  These documents will take the form of recommendations for best-practices in information lifecycle management that could improve the preservability and accessibility of electronic information produced by the content creator.  An educational awareness and advocacy outreach program will take place in 2018, the second year of the project.  The aim of this program will be to start new dialogues on the issues in preserving and providing access to electronic government information, engaging the broader library community, relevant academic and public scholars, federal agencies, and other relevant stakeholders.  Finally, the project will analyze and develop recommendations for a collaborative agenda for future work to continue improving preservation and access to electronic government information.

We’ll introduce the panel with a proposed definition of service management that we hope will resonate with the community. This will provide a touchstone we can revisit throughout the panel discussion, to “kick the tires” and see if it holds true. Using questions solicited from the DLF membership prior to the Forum, as panelists we intend to weave common themes revealed in the questions -- in lightning talk style/format. Each panelist will outline their service management role at their institution, and lay the foundation for open discussion by revealing both successes and learning opportunities they have experienced. Community questions along with audience queries will drive the remaining, and most substantial part of the hour with facilitated dialogue.
 
The goals of the panel are to support and encourage interested DLF members in furthering the discussion of their service management work, to share locally developed best practices and frameworks and explore training venues. An opportunity exists to establish the value of service management work in the digital LAM community to: organizations, management and our immediate team members and allied colleagues. Can a threshold be established for a service needing a service manager, where one may not exist?  How does service management practice contribute to successful, established teams? What value is added by incorporating service management principles into existing digital LAM programs? Who typically performs service management work, and does it have a gendered component? How do we value service management work in organizations where it already exists? Issues of compensation and organizational relationships are challenging, yet ripe topics for exploration. Issues of diversity in staffing service management roles, when and where they exist, are among the tough questions we must ask. Who does the work? Who might be excluded from it? Who avoids it?
 
Ultimately, as with all DLF community dialogue, the attendees, panelists, questioners and other contributors will grow the service management community of practice with the umbrella of support and encouragement provided by DLF and CLIR. As panelists we’re seizing a moment of intense interest, sparked by a discussion on the DLF project managers list, to share our experiences and learn from our colleagues in the audience. We may be the ones brave -- or foolish! -- enough to serve as panelists, but we’re confident there is a wealth of knowledge amongst our colleagues we’d like to draw out.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--0900:00,2017--1000:00,0

As a land-grant institution with a strong service mission, the University Libraries at Virginia Tech has developed a digital preservation service aimed at the development of partnerships with regional cultural heritage organizations. A prime example of such a partnership lies in the work provided by data curation and digital preservation services to the Barter Theater.

Barter Theater is an arts organization located in rural southwestern Virginia. In 1933 Robert Porterfield, a local actor, brought a group of professional actors to Abingdon and opened a theater during the Great Depression. The theatre got its name from its practice of allowing audiences to barter food for admission. It has since distinguished itself as the State Theatre of Virginia and has had a significant impact on Virginia’s culture and economy. Having such a historical significance the digitization and dissemination of Barters archive has been long overdue. In effort to support the preservation of Barters archive, Virginia Tech began a pilot project to help digitize their archives. The project consisted of converting an obsolete proprietary database saved on outdated media and converting it to an open format saved to stable media. 

This presentation will use the Barter project as a case study to demonstrate the complexity of creating a forensic data recovery service for a regional cultural heritage organization, which in itself is a political act due to the socio-economic conditions of the Appalachian region.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--0900:00,,0

The IMLS-funded event was designed as an opportunity to allow members of the NDSR community to build connections, present achievements, share knowledge, and discuss the sustainability and long-term goals of the NDSR initiative. Over the course of the two-day Symposium, speakers presented around five suggested topics: models and strategies for making programs like NDSR sustainable; expanding the geographic reach of NDSR; methods of fostering a digital preservation community of practice; raising awareness of the NDSR program; and models and strategies for effective mentorship. After the presentations, attendees joined in small-group discussions to create the framework for an NDSR Handbook that would provide guidance for future NDSR programs and the development of a national NDSR model.

National Digital Stewardship Residencies (NDSR) have branched, by funding from IMLS, into areas outside of the original NDSR DC environment, leading to the creation of the Biodiversity Heritage Library cohort, American Archive of Public Broadcasting cohort, Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Art Libraries Society of North America (ARLIS/NA) cohort. If anything, this has underscored the success NDSR residencies have in serving as a launchpad for the careers of residents. Featuring recent residents and mentors from Georgetown University and Johns Hopkins University, this presentation will focus on how residencies can be made into win-win situations for both the residents and the institutions. Perspectives from the residents’ side on their expectations, and how they are using the residencies to launch their careers will be discussed, while mentors will discuss how they turn these opportunities into ones that help the institutions make cases for personnel and resources, and jump start projects locally.
	While the panel will focus on recent NDSR residencies at these two institutions, we’ll also conceptualize how the strategies could be generalized across other residencies that may not be a part of the NDSR model, and how institutions can use, and build upon, residencies. Often the discussion of residencies focuses around tools and concepts, however, in this presentation we'll include how they helped the host institutions analyze and modify existing strategies and workflows, based on the discoveries and work done by the residents. This will lead into a discussion of the positive changes that the residents and their work can bring about in their host institutions, and help them reassess and reinstitute modified strategies that can benefit the institutions considerably. Often making these suggestions can be politically fraught. How does the resident come in as an outsider and give a thorough critique of existing strategies without offending those who created the strategies in the first place? From the residents’ perspectives, the discussion will focus on core competency expectations, reality, and the ‘acronym soup’ in digital preservation projects. As new professionals in the digital preservation realm, do residents’ expectations align with reality, and if not, where are the distinctions and can the gap be bridged in some way, or does it even need to be?
	At the same time there can be scope creep in these projects, causing the resident to take on too much work outside their project and creating an imbalance between benefits received by resident and host. In what ways can a residency be made to maintain this balance while many institutions are in a situation where they are being forced to “do more with less.” The audience will leave with tangible ideas on how residencies can benefit their institutions and if there are Library Science/Archives/Information Science students in the audience, they’ll get ideas for how residencies can benefit their career and how expectations can differ from reality in practice.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--0900:00,,0

The presentation will focus on variations of how to move forward once a digital preservation plan has been developed or not and platforms and environments have been selected. Should everything be expected to flow smoothly? What can digital preservationists in libraries anticipate and expect, and how might they handle failures and issues once they are encountered? Once a library administration has given funds for this preservation platform, how do you deal with the internal political pressure to implement these services to show that it is not just money going to waste?
While the presentation will discuss workflows and technological setups that were developed at the two libraries (with many solutions that are available as open source), it will also engage in a discourse of expectations, successes, and failures. Digital Library and Digital Preservation staff are often expected to develop seamless and functional operations once a digital preservation platform or environment has been selected, however, the reality is vastly different. Through this panel discussion, we’d like to bring to the forefront the issues that may arise in even the best-laid plans, including in workflows that have been thoroughly tested. Can we ever say that we have a complete grasp on the entirety of our assets that need to be preserved? If not, then when do we feel good enough to move forward with our plans? 
The Libraries at both institutions use Academic Preservation Trust (APTrust) as part of their preservation environment. We’ll discuss the successes and issues involved in designing, implementing, and automating workflows for digital assets that are housed in different digital repositories and content storage areas. This will involve showcasing the locally developed tools, considerations, and workflows for each of the asset classes and the local policies that help us keep an inventory of our submissions. Considerations and the underlying conceptualization of workflows for the purposes of preservation and access will be shared along with how they could be generalized for broader use by the community. 
The attendees will not only leave with an idea of where to go once a preservation plan has been created and a preservation environment has been selected but will also know where to access open source tools that can be generalized for setting up local workflows. Furthermore, we hope that the attendees will have an open discussion about what the roadblocks to implementing digital preservation strategies are so that as a community we can identify common areas that need improvement and resources to help us more forward towards the goal of preserving our digital assets.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--0900:00,,0

The recent behavior of the U.S. Federal Government is only the most recent; it echoes the purging of government datasets and historical records by Canada's Harper administration just several years ago. Examples like these are, sadly, not historically novel; they reflect a common impulse of those in power to censor information that runs contrary to their agenda.

We are more vulnerable to these attacks than we've ever been. In a print world, distributed repositories maintained local copies of government information through programs like the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). Digital information has decoupled the necessary connection between distributed access and distributed custody, at once making the dissemination of government information more efficient but also more easily altered or deleted.

What we need to address these threats is the strategy we've always ever relied upon: lots of copies, keeping stuff safe. It matters also that the copies be maintained in independent repositories that remain skeptical about the integrity of information stored in others, and that themselves operate transparently. Finally, digital information allows for an enhanced mechanism of mutual audit of the replicated copies.

The LOCKSS Program has built software and supports networks that provide these features. We're one of many organizations and communities working in this space.

Each of these Residencies has faced political challenges both within the organizational host as well as within the program that administers the group of Residencies. Political issues have ranged from a lack of staff recognition that digital preservation should be a priority, to balancing the interests of a stewardship project against the mission of the administering organization and the educational needs of the Resident.

The focus of the panel discussion will be on success stories and lessons learned. What has worked for the panelists? What techniques can be transferred into other organizations? IT staff within your organization have great potential as allies. Unfortunately, IT staff  can also throw up roadblocks when there is not a shared vision, common vocabulary, and understanding. 

The members of the panel will represent a wide range of experience across different types of organizations including government agencies, an international organization, academia, libraries, and museums. Members of the panel have also been selected based on their first hand experience and research into the challenges of building bridges with the information technology community, both within their own organizations and throughout the digital preservation community.

Some topics that are likely to be discussed include: 
Identifying and winning allies
Finding common language
Spotting roadblocks
Understanding the priorities of IT teams

In addition, we will look to the recently published “Demystifying IT: A Framework for Shared Understanding between Archivists and IT Professionals” from OCLC Research for discussion points and takeaways.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,"I was a bit confused by the ""presenting author"" checkbox.

While working within the strictures of archives built to reinforce oppressive power structures as well as standards-driven, supposedly content-neutral digital preservation principles, digital archivists have an important role to play in pushing for more radical and liberatory practices. Staff working with digital materials in small institutions have more competing demands on their time, but also have the ability to effect change at multiple stages of the digital records lifecycle: writing more critically engaged policy, developing documentation strategies to focus on dissent and underrepresented voices, collecting materials with thoughtfulness about power relationships and consent, developing equitable relationships with records creators, shaping descriptive practices with appropriate community context, ensuring adequate levels of preservation for threatened materials, providing accessible platforms for users, and bringing in members of the community and staff at all stages as full collaborators. I will draw from my experiences--both positive ones and complete failures--at an archives and special collections at a small HWI, but I will provide broader suggestions for incorporating the frameworks of equity, justice, and a feminist ethics of care into the day-to-day activities of anyone who works in digital preservation.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--1000:00,,0

His answer was resoundingly in the affirmative, stating that “the machines, structures, and systems of modern material culture can be accurately judged not only for their contributions of efficiency and productivity, not merely for their positive and negative environmental side effects, but also for the ways in which they can embody specific forms of power and authority.""  A rich body of scholarship has further advanced the insight that artifacts can embody, advance and inhibit specific human values.   As caretakers of information artifacts, information professionals are significant actors in such politics.
In order to understand the role that digital preservation plays in the politics of digital information, it is important to recognize that, unlike analog artifacts, digital objects reside at several distinct, but interrelated levels of representation.  The decisions that information professionals make related to those levels of representation can have dramatic effects on what voices are heard, what interests are represented and how identity is shaped.
In this presentation, I will elaborate several specific types of decisions that librarians and archivists are now facing in relation to collections of born-digital materials, and the ways in which these decisions are concrete manifestations of politics.  These decisions range from what information to extract from original source materials, to what information is masked or redacted, to what sorts of entities are identified and presented to users.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--1000:00,,0

The Libraries acquired this collection, one of the largest in the country and the Big Ten Academic Alliance, through individual donations, donations of large private collectors, and bulk purchases of duplicates from other institutions. In an early collaboration with the Libraries, the Jewish Studies Department made the purchases and also funded early processing and cataloging because the faculty wanted their students’ studies rooted in the value of knowledge and books; this call number range boasts some of the highest circulation statistics among Libraries’ collections. Within this collection, many of the rare texts were stored in the library basement, too fragile to be circulated, and not prioritized for cataloging due to this fragility. In 2013, the Jewish Studies Department again approached the Libraries to catalog, digitize, and ingest these volumes a repository, to facilitate student access to this collection and as a measure of preserving the texts for future scholars. This presentation will discuss the four-year collaborative partnership between Libraries departments and the Jewish Studies Department to catalog, digitize, ingest, and preserve these texts, highlighting the unique funding model that has ingested nearly 900 volumes into HathiTrust over the last three years. This presentation will also address the many challenges in making these texts publicly available, including challenges overcoming copyright access restrictions.",1,,,0,0,0,0,,,,0,On Hold,,,,,,2017--1000:00,,0
